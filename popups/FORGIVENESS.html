<h3>Forgiveness (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">You’ve likely been holding onto a wound—maybe for years. And it’s not because you’re weak. It’s because the pain was real. The betrayal was deep. The loss was unbearable. Forgiveness can feel impossible when you’ve been the one hurt, mistreated, abandoned, or abused. That’s why we don’t rush this part. We don’t force it. We walk into it with truth, tenderness, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="">Through a short but powerful video, you’ll learn what forgiveness really is—and what it’s not. You’ll gain clarity on why forgiveness is essential for <em>your</em> healing, even if the other person never apologizes or changes. Then, as a reflective exercise, you’ll be invited to write a forgiveness piece connected to your story. This isn’t about performance or perfection. It’s about positioning your heart to begin letting go. </p>
<p class="">One of the biggest things we need to understand about forgiveness is this: <strong>it’s for you—not for them.</strong></p>
<p class="">Jesus doesn’t ask us to forgive so others can feel better. He asks us to forgive because <em>He</em> knows what anger, bitterness, hatred, and resentment will do to our souls. It's a command, not a request. Why? Because they are spiritual toxins—poison that contaminates our peace, our joy, our relationships, and even our sense of identity.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Forgiveness is the only way to take out the trash and clean our hearts.</strong></p>
<p class="">It’s not weakness—it’s spiritual strength. It’s not forgetting—it’s choosing to free ourselves from the burden of carrying all of that anger, bitterness, hatred, and resentment.</p>
<p class="">Even if you don’t feel fully ready, taking this step—however small—as it begins to unhook your soul from the grip of that story, that person, that pain. It’s like breaking a chain you didn’t even realize was still wrapped around you.</p>
<p class="">And here’s the truth that brings hope: Jesus is not asking you to do this alone. He <em>is</em> your strength. He’s already forgiven you more than you’ll ever be asked to forgive others. And He will walk with you through every word, every tear, every act of surrender.</p>
<p class="">This is where the healing process takes root.<br />This is where healing deepens.<br /> This is where freedom starts.<br /> This is where Jesus shows up—in the mess, in the mercy, and in the miracle of letting go.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Forgiveness doesn’t excuse their behavior. It prevents their behavior from destroying your heart.</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.</em><br /> <em>—Ephesians 4:31–32 (ESV)</em></p>
