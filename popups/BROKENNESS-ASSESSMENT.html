<h3>Brokenness Assessment (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">You won’t need to write out your entire life story here. This isn’t about putting your trauma on display—it’s about giving me a way to understand the landscape of your heart: the struggles you’ve faced, the losses you’ve carried, the heartaches that still echo, and the patterns that keep repeating. You’ll simply check boxes that reflect what you’ve experienced or are still wrestling with. That’s it.</p>
<p class="">But this step is <em>incredibly</em> important for both of us.</p>
<p class="">For you, it’s a way to pause and reflect—sometimes for the first time—on what’s really going on beneath the surface. It shines a light on areas where God wants to bring healing, restoration, and truth.</p>
<p class="">For me, it’s a way to pray more specifically, listen more intentionally, and tailor our conversations in a way that honors what you’ve been through. There are times when certain patterns, experiences, or strongholds point to deeper spiritual issues—things that may need to be addressed through spiritual deliverance or intentional inner healing work. I won’t overwhelm you with that language upfront, but I’ll be watching for those signs as I review your responses with prayer and discernment.</p>
<p class="">This isn’t about labeling you—it’s about understanding how to walk with you. Everyone’s story is different. Everyone’s healing path is personal. And this assessment helps us begin yours with wisdom, sensitivity, and Jesus at the center.</p>
<p class=""><strong>You are safe here. You don’t have to carry this alone anymore.</strong></p>
