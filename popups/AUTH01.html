<h3>Why I Write (the details)</h3>
<p>After saying yes to writing the book, I found myself on a path I never expected. Every day for three years, I wrote. I didn’t realize how much God had stored in me until it started pouring out. By the end, I had written over 270,000 words—more than enough for four books. The Holy Spirit was clearly on a roll. It was exhilarating. But then I was left with a massive question: Now what?</p>
<p>Nobody wants to read a 270,000-word debut. That’s when God shifted the vision from a single book to a full series. I divided the manuscript into ten focused parts, each exploring a different layer of truth. On my son’s birthday in January 2018, I released Book 1: What Does God Want? I thought the hard part was over. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>Marketing crushed me. I had poured everything into this message, but the response was underwhelming. It felt like God had gone silent. I did what I often do—I pitched a fit. A full-blown temper tantrum. Then everything started to unravel: I lost my job, my stability, my identity. One relationship after another crumbled. People I trusted walked away. It felt like I had failed everyone—including God.</p>
<p>I started writing letters I never thought I’d have to write. One to my wife after our marriage collapsed. One to my daughter when we became estranged. I was angry. Heartbroken. And deeply disappointed in God. “Where are You?” I asked over and over. “I did what You asked. Why does it feel like You left?”</p>
<p>But He hadn’t left. He was right there with me—quietly walking me through the wreckage. Letting the old foundation crumble so He could rebuild it the right way. It was in the middle of that brokenness, sitting in a counseling session, that the phrase Healing MY Story came to me. Because that’s what I needed. Not theory. Not theology. Healing.</p>
<p>That’s when everything shifted. Writing wasn’t just a skill anymore—it became part of my healing. And part of yours too. God wasn’t preparing me for a platform. He was preparing me for people. For you. For the pain you're carrying and the healing He still wants to bring into your story.</p>

Why I Write...

The short answer? Because God asked me to.

The long answer? Well that starts back in June of 2012. At the time, I was absolutely terrified of public speaking. I could do it—people even said I was good at it—but what they didn’t see was the absolute fear and terror that gripped me for days beforehand. I was sick to my stomach. Paralyzed by fear. And not just of speaking… but of sharing my faith.

So, I joined Toastmasters. I made a quiet decision: every speech I gave would include God. Not in a flashy or pushy way—but because I needed to stop being afraid to speak His name. I figured if I worked Him into every speech, maybe—just maybe—I’d start feeling more comfortable, that the fear and terror would go away.

It worked. In fact, it worked so well that I ended up competing and winning my club’s International speech contest, then my area, then my district, and advanced to the Regional Finals. I was one step away from representing our region on the international stage. I thought I’d found my calling: motivational speaker, Toastmasters champion, faith-sharer.

But God had other plans, I came in second.

Then in October of 2014, He asked me, “Walker, I want you to write a book.”

My response? “I don’t write books—I write computer code.”

He said, “I know. But I want you to write a book anyway.”

So I tried dodging the call one more time. “God, I don’t have anything to say.”

He gently reminded me, “You’ve written ten speeches already, I think you can write a book.”

So I said yes.

And for the next three years, I wrote. Every day. I poured my heart out, word by word. By the end, I had written over 270,000 words—enough for four books. I didn't realize I had so much to say. You know when the Holy Spirit get's on a role, you can't shut Him up sometimes! It was fun, I enjoyed the process, I learned a lot. 

Then came the question: Now what?

No one wants to read a first-time author’s 270,000-word book. I didn’t know what to do with what I had written. That’s when God shifted the vision from a single book to a series. The Perspectives series was born.

I broke the manuscript into ten parts—each one focusing on a different aspect of the truth. Then, on my son’s birthday in January 2018, I published Book 1: What Does God Want?

But then came the hardest part: marketing. Writing the book was difficult—but marketing? That felt impossible. I was crushed by the lack of response. I thought I had done everything right. But it felt like God had gone silent. So I did what I often do when I’m frustrated—I pitched a fit. A good, old-fashioned temper-tantrum. What can I say, I'm a professional!

 

The Hard Season…

And just when I thought things couldn’t get worse—I lost my job.

It wasn’t just the paycheck. It was my identity. My stability. My plan. Gone.

And then came the relational earthquakes—one after another. I was hurt. Betrayed. Misunderstood. Shut out. I lost the people I thought would always be in my corner. I felt abandoned. Alone. Like I had failed everyone—God included.

I wrote letters during that time—letters I never imagined I’d have to write. One to my wife… after our marriage unraveled. One to my daughter… when everything between us fell apart. Those were some of the hardest words I’ve ever put on paper.

I was angry. I was heartbroken. I was exhausted.

And truthfully? I was disappointed in God.

I kept asking, “Where are You? I did what You asked. I wrote the book. I showed up. Why does it feel like You disappeared?”

But here’s the truth: He didn’t disappear.

He was walking with me through all of it—the silence, the wreckage, the grief, the confusion. He never left. He never stopped loving me. He was just letting the ground beneath me break apart… so He could rebuild it the right way.

It was in that season of complete brokenness—while I was sitting in counseling, trying to make sense of the mess—that the phrase Healing MY Story came to me. Not someone else's story. My story. Because I needed healing. I needed to face the wounds I’d been carrying. And I needed to be reminded that healing wasn’t a theory. It was a promise.

And that’s where the calling shifted.

Writing wasn’t just something I did. It became something God used—to help me, and now to help others. He was preparing me… not for a platform, but for people. For you. For the pain you’re walking through. For the healing He wants to bring in your story.

 

Why the Perspectives Series…

The short answer? Because no one taught me these things when I was growing up Christian. Most of them I had to learn the hard way. You know, make the mistake by picking up stupid and playing with it! No one said, “Hey Walker, put down stupid, back away from stupid—you’ll get hurt if you don’t!”

The long answer? Well, that starts back when I was fifteen, almost sixteen years old—that’s when I gave my life to Christ. And like so many others, I was told the usual things: Read your Bible. Pray. Go to church. And you’ll be fine.

Understand, those things are tools. They’re not the goal or the objective. They help with what God wants, but they’re not what He actually wants. No one told me that.

No one told me that building a real relationship with God takes more than rules, regulations, and rituals—it takes surrender, trust, and truth. And no one taught me what all of that meant. So, when life got hard—when God gave me not one but two sons with special needs—everything in my faith collapsed. I didn’t have a foundation from which to stand. I didn't trust God, because trust wasn’t on the list. For that matter, I didn’t even know how to trust God—and I certainly didn’t understand how important it was.

I had memory verses, sure, but no anchor.

No one had taught me how to want what God wants. No one had ever shown me what that actually looked like—or why it was so important to invest in my relationship with God personally.

So now? That’s what I’m doing. That’s what this series is all about.

The Perspectives series isn’t just a bunch of books. It’s everything I’ve learned—usually the hard way—about what it means to walk with God, to hear Him, to trust Him, to wrestle with Him, and to stay when it would be easier to run. Understand, I'm not this smart, I had a lot of the Holy Spirit, pastors, teachers, authors, speakers mentor me along the way. Each book in the series walks you through the process of wanting what God wants, knowing what God wants, and investing in what God wants.

Simple. Straightforward. Truth—in love.
