<h2>Here’s what you’ll find as you travel the road of <em>Perspective</em>:</h2>

<p><strong>Book 1 – What Does God Want?</strong><br>
The foundation. What God wants isn’t religion—it’s relationship. A strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with you. This book helps you see what He’s really after, why it matters, and why you need it more than you know.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 2 – The Power of Choice</strong><br>
Every moment is filled with choices—and every choice has consequences. This book helps you understand the origin, weight, and eternal impact of your decisions, especially the one that matters most: yes God or no God?
</p>

<p><strong>Book 3 – Knowing Who You Are in Christ</strong><br>
The enemy will always attack your identity first—because if you forget who you are, you’ll forget who He is. This book will help you rebuild your identity on God’s truth, not past pain, shame, lies, or labels. You are not your mistakes. You are not what others did to you. You are who He says you are—redeemed, chosen, loved, and secure in Christ.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 4 – Is the Bible the Word of God?</strong><br>
You don’t need blind faith. You need solid evidence. This book tackles the big questions: Can you trust the Bible? Is it reliable? Is it still alive? From historical proof to fulfilled prophecy, this is where trust in Scripture begins to grow deep roots.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 5 – Grasping the Trinity</strong><br>
Three persons. One God. No contradiction. Just mystery, beauty, and divine relationship. This book walks you through understanding the Godhead—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—not as separate gods or confusing masks—but as one united God who longs to walk with you.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 6 – Knowing God the Father</strong><br>
Not distant. Not angry. Not waiting to punish. This book helps you see the Father as He truly is—loving, faithful, patient, kind, and always present. The kind of Father your heart has always needed but maybe never knew was possible.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 7 – Knowing God the Son</strong><br>
Jesus isn’t just a name in a story—He’s the Savior who bled for you, the King who reigns for you, and the Friend who walks with you. This book brings Jesus into focus, helping you know Him, follow Him, and love Him more deeply than ever before.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 8 – Knowing God the Holy Spirit</strong><br>
Whisperer. Helper. Power source. He’s more than a force or a feeling—He’s God living inside you. This book will help you understand how the Holy Spirit works, how to listen to Him, and how to walk in the power He provides.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 9 – Knowing Your Enemy</strong><br>
Yes, you have one. And he hates you almost as much as he hates God. Why? Because you were created in His image. Since he can’t hurt God directly, he tries to hurt God by hurting you. This book unmasks the strategies of the devil—lies, shame, fear, confusion—and equips you with truth, clarity, and authority in Christ. The battle is real, but the victory is assured.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 10 – Investing in Your Relationship with God</strong><br>
Relationships don’t grow accidentally—they grow intentionally. This book helps you develop spiritual rhythms that deepen your connection with God: prayer, worship, obedience, stillness, trust, and surrender. Not rules—just relationship.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 11 – Living Your Relationship with God</strong><br>
Faith isn’t meant to sit on a shelf. This book brings it all together—how to live out your relationship with God in your daily life. You’ll learn to walk in love, extend grace, endure trials, share your faith, and live with boldness, joy, and victory.
</p>

<p><strong>Book 12 – Knowing the Promises of God</strong><br>
God doesn’t just speak truth—He keeps it. This book unpacks the promises God has already made to you: about peace, provision, purpose, forgiveness, freedom, and your future. When you know what He’s promised, you’ll stop striving and start standing. These aren’t motivational phrases—they’re anchors for your soul.
