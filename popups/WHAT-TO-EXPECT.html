<h3 class="">Here's What You Can Expect:</h3>
<p class=""><strong>1. A Safe, Confidential Space</strong><br /> Everything we talk about is held in strict confidence. This is your space to be real—without fear of being shamed, rushed, or shut down. You don’t need to impress me, filter yourself, or pretend to be okay. This is holy ground. It’s okay to cry here. It’s okay to be angry here. It’s okay to be honest here.</p>
<p class=""><strong>2. A Spirit-Led Conversation</strong><br /> I don’t show up with a checklist. I show up with discernment, compassion, and a desire to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. Every session is different because every story is different. We go at the pace God sets—and the one your heart can handle.</p>
<p class=""><strong>3. Practical Steps Toward Healing</strong><br /> We’re not just talking—we’re moving. As we uncover what’s hurting, we’ll also identify what’s helping, what’s hindering, and where God is leading. I’ll give you biblical tools, insights, and encouragement you can actually use in your day-to-day life. You’ll begin to see your patterns, lies you’ve believed, truths you need, and steps you can take toward lasting change.</p>
<p class=""><strong>4. Ownership of Your Journey</strong><br /> I’m not here to fix you. I'm here to walk with you as you face what needs to be faced. You decide how deep to go. You choose how far to walk. The healing belongs to God, but the journey requires your partnership. This isn’t passive. This is intentional. If you’re ready to do the work, I’m ready to walk with you. Understand, I can't want for YOU more than YOU want for yourself! This is your journey. I'm here to help you discover the Healer of YOUR Story!</p>
<p class=""><strong>5. God at the Center of It All</strong><br /> This is not behavior modification. This is not life coaching with a sprinkle of Scripture. This is a Christ-centered journey into healing, freedom, transformation, and restoration. Every conversation is rooted in the belief that Jesus is the Healer, the Restorer, and the One who sets the captives free. My job is to help you meet Him in the middle of your pain.</p>

<h3 class="">So What Does a Session Look Like?</h3>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Length:</strong> Most sessions last about 45-55 minutes</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Format:</strong> We’ll meet via Zoom or phone (or in-person if local and agreed upon)</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Style:</strong> Gentle but honest conversation, Spirit-led prayer, listening, processing, and coaching</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Questions: </strong>Understand, the first thing I need to do is get to know you, so, be prepared for me to ask a ton of questions, even the hard questions, so that I can understand things from your perspective.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Cost:</strong> My Bill rate is $125 per hour. I do have session plans you can purchase that bring the cost lower if you buy 4 or 8 sessions at a time. I do have some pro-bono options, so don't be afraid to ask for assistance should you need it.</p>
</li>
<li class=""><strong>Homework:</strong> Be prepared for a little homework. Doing your homework will be the key to the speed in which your healing occurs. There are things you need to learn. Things you need to understand. Correct perspectives you need to own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ready to Start?</strong><br /> If you’ve made it this far, maybe it’s because something inside you is stirring—something that knows it’s time. Freedom Coaching isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about showing up and saying, “I’m willing.” If that’s you, I’d be honored to walk this road with you.</p>
