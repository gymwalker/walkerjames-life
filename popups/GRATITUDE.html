<h3>Gratitude (Continue...)</h3>
<p class="">You’ll revisit the story you’ve written, not to relive the pain, but to intentionally look for where God’s hand may have been present—even in the shadows. You’ll ask:</p>
<p class=""><em>Where did I survive when I should’ve been destroyed?</em><br /> <em>What truth held me when I couldn’t hold myself?</em><br /> <em>Where did God show up, even if I didn’t notice Him at the time?</em></p>
<p class="">This exercise isn’t about thanking the people who hurt you. It’s not about dismissing injustice, bypassing grief, or pretending everything’s fine. That’s <em>toxic positivity,</em> and it has no place here.<br /> This is something deeper. Truer. Holier.</p>
<p class="">This is about thanking the <strong>God who saw you</strong>, sustained you, and never abandoned you. Even when you couldn’t feel Him. Even when your pain drowned out His voice. Gratitude is how we begin to <em>breathe again</em>. It’s how we reclaim the ability to see beauty, experience peace, and choose joy—not because everything is fixed, but because we’re finally letting go of the need to carry it all alone.</p>
<p class="">Gratitude doesn’t remove your past. But it reframes it. And in that reframing, your heart finds fresh perspective—one grounded not in what was done to you, but in what God is still doing <em>in</em> and for you.</p>
<p class="">And for me as your guide, seeing what you’re grateful for—even after everything—helps me understand what’s giving you strength. It lets me measure your progress. It shows me where God is already working. And it gives us both a reminder that healing isn’t just about what you’ve come through—it’s about who you’re becoming.</p>
<p class=""><strong>How you are letting the healing process transform you!</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. — 1 Thessalonians 5:18 (ESV)</em></p>
