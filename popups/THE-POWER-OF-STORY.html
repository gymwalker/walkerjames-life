<h3>The Power of Story (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">This part of the process is one of the most powerful steps we’ll take together—and also one of the most sacred.</p>
<p class="">You’ll be invited to write down one specific story from your life: one that still aches, still echoes, or still feels unresolved. It doesn’t have to be the worst moment of your life—but it should be the one that rises to the surface when you think, <em>“This still hurts… I’m not over this.”</em></p>
<p class="">You won’t be doing this alone. I’ll give you a simple guide and a short video that walks you through the <em>why</em> behind this exercise, as well as <em>how</em> to approach it with honesty, gentleness, and intention. You’ll take time—on your own, in a quiet place where you feel safe—to write it all down. No censoring. No minimizing. No skipping over the hard parts. This is your story, your voice, and your truth. And it needs to be told.</p>
<p class="">Not to everyone. Just to one person—me. In our session together, you’ll read your story aloud. I’ll be listening, not to critique or analyze, but to <em>witness</em>. Because when your story is heard by someone who sees you through the lens of Jesus’ love, something shifts. Shame begins to lose its grip. Isolation starts to crumble. And the lies that have wrapped themselves around your memory of the moment start to unravel.</p>
<p class="">This is where healing begins.</p>
<p class="">For you, the act of telling the story is often more powerful than you expect. For me, it’s a moment of deep listening, spiritual discernment, and prayerful insight. What you share gives me clarity on how best to support you—whether there are wounds that need tending, lies that need breaking, or strongholds that need to be torn down in Jesus’ name.</p>
<p class="">This isn’t about reliving your trauma. It’s about releasing it.<br /> It’s about reclaiming the parts of your story that pain tried to steal—and letting Jesus rewrite them with truth, freedom, and redemption.</p>
<p class="">You are more than what happened to you. And your story isn’t over.<br /> It’s just beginning to be healed. And remember:</p>
<p class=""><em><strong>The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.—Psalm 34:18</strong></em></p>
