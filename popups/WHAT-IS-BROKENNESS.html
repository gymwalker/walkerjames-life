<h3>What is Brokenness (Continued)...</h3>
<p class="">Brokenness is the emotional, mental, or spiritual pain that leaves you feeling discouraged, crushed, or hopeless. It can make life feel unbearable, relationships feel empty, and every day feels like a fight just to get through.</p>
<p class="">Brokenness steals your joy. It robs your peace. It drains your purpose.</p>
<hr class="" />
<h3 class="">The Many Faces of Brokenness</h3>
<p class="">Brokenness doesn’t always look the same, but it often stems from:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Loss</strong> – A loved one, a job, a relationship, a dream, financial freedom</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Betrayal</strong> – Lies, abandonment, or abuse from someone you trusted</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Trauma</strong> – Emotional, physical, or sexual abuse… bullying… injustice… violence</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Uncontrollable Circumstances</strong> – When someone else’s choices damage your life and leave you cleaning up the mess</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Inner Struggles</strong> – Shame, regret, insecurity, unworthiness, depression, suicidal thoughts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">And here’s the brutal reality: <strong>hurt people often hurt people.</strong></p>
<p class="">Broken people break people—intentionally or not—and the cycle keeps going until someone decides to stop it.</p>
<hr class="" />
<h3 class="">How Brokenness Shows Up</h3>
<p class="">It doesn't always look like sadness. It might look like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Explosive Anger</strong> – Because it's easier than admitting you're hurt</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Isolation</strong> – Withdrawing because it’s safer to shut down than risk being rejected</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Addictions</strong> – Alcohol, porn, drugs, social media, food… anything to escape the pain</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Self-Punishment</strong> – Cutting, sabotaging relationships, believing you deserve the pain</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class=""><strong>Head Noise</strong> – The non-stop inner critic saying, <em>“You’ll never be enough. You’re a failure. No one really cares.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">Sound familiar?</p>
<p class="">It should—because brokenness doesn’t discriminate.</p>
<p class="">It doesn’t care how old you are, how much money you make, what church you go to, or how “put together” you look. At some point, <strong>every one of us wrestles with it—either directly or through the people we love.</strong></p>
<p class="">Left unhealed, brokenness creates pain that lasts for years… and sometimes for generations.</p>
<hr class="" />
<h3 class="">But Brokenness Is Not the End</h3>
<p class="">And here’s what I need you to hear:</p>
<p class=""><strong>Brokenness is not permanent.</strong><br /> <strong>It’s not your identity.</strong><br /> <strong>And it’s definitely not your destiny.</strong></p>
<p class="">You are not alone in your pain. You are not beyond healing. And you are not stuck forever.</p>
<p class="">I know what brokenness feels like—because I’ve lived it.</p>
<p class="">I’ve walked through loss, betrayal, failure, rejection, anger, shame, and hopelessness. But I’ve also discovered the only path to healing: <strong>bringing it all to Jesus.</strong></p>
<p class="">That’s what Freedom Coaching is about.</p>
<p class="">It’s about walking into what hurts—not alone, and not empty-handed—but with truth, compassion, and the presence of the One who knows how to heal every wound.</p>
<p class="">This is a journey.<br /> It won’t be easy.<br /> But you won’t have to do it alone.<br />And it will be worth it!</p>
<p class="">I’ll walk beside you.<br /> Jesus will meet us there.</p>
<p class="">So let me ask you…</p>
<p class=""><strong>Are you ready to take the first step toward healing? Toward freedom? Toward peace?</strong></p>
<p class="">If so, let’s begin. Together.</p>
