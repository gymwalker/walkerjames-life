<h3>More on Who I Help and How...</h3>
<p>But here’s the hard truth: My biggest problem is the same one God has—I can’t want for you more than you want for yourself. Freedom isn’t forced. Healing isn’t automatic.</p>
<p>You have to want this for YOU, I can't do this for YOU, only you can do this for you!</p>
<p>And if you do, I’m ready to walk with you—step by step, prayer by prayer, truth by truth—into the freedom, healing and transformation that Jesus died to give you.</p>
<p>Because your story matters.</p>
<p>And Jesus is not done with you yet.</p>
