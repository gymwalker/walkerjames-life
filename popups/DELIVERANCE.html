<h3>Deliverance (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">If we prayerfully discern that this kind of spiritual interference is present—whether through heaviness, torment, confusion, addiction, fear, compulsions, or anything that just won’t let go—we’ll gently walk through a <strong>Spirit-led process of deliverance</strong> together.</p>
<p class="">This is not weird. It’s not loud. And it’s not scary.<br /> <strong>It’s biblical. It’s beautiful. It’s powerful.</strong><br /> And it’s all done in the name and authority of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="">Deliverance simply means <em>handing over what doesn’t belong to you anymore</em>—the bondage, the lies, the attachments, the torment—and <strong>letting Jesus take it from you completely.</strong></p>
<p class="">We walk through renouncing what’s not of God, breaking spiritual agreements, and inviting the Holy Spirit to fill every place that had once been held in darkness. It’s not a ritual. It’s a rescue.</p>
<p class="">This is one of the most sacred, humbling, and holy parts of the healing journey. There’s no shame in needing deliverance—many of us do, and most people never even realize it. But when it happens, it’s like watching God restore your broken heart in a single act of mercy.</p>
<p class=""><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou feel lighter. Clearer. Restored. Transformed. Free. </strong></p>
<p class="">Chains fall. Fog lifts. The lies go quiet. And your spirit finally breathes.</p>
<p class="">As your guide, I will never force this step. I will never shame you for needing it. And I will never walk you into something unprepared. If we sense deliverance is needed, we’ll talk through what to expect, how to prepare, and walk every step prayerfully, gently, and under the covering of Jesus’ name and blood.</p>
<p class="">Deliverance is not the end of your story.</p>
<p class=""><strong>The chains are gone. I’ve been set free.<br /> Not by my power, but by His mercy.<br /> Jesus stepped in—and the darkness fled.<br />Now my story has meaning, now my real story begins.<br /></strong></p>
