<h2>The Hard Season…</h2>

<p>
Just when I thought things couldn’t get worse—I lost my job.
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t just the paycheck. It was my identity. My stability. My plan. Gone.
</p>

<p>
And then came the relational earthquakes—one after another. I was hurt. Betrayed. Misunderstood. Shut out. I lost the people I thought would always be in my corner. I felt abandoned. Alone. Like I had failed everyone—God included.
</p>

<p>
I wrote letters during that time—letters I never imagined I’d have to write. One to my wife… after our marriage unraveled. One to my daughter… when everything between us fell apart. Those were some of the hardest words I’ve ever put on paper.
</p>

<p>
I was angry. I was heartbroken. I was exhausted. And truthfully? I was disappointed in God.
</p>

<p>
I kept asking, “Where are You? I did what You asked. I wrote the book. I showed up. Why does it feel like You disappeared?”
</p>

<p>
But here’s the truth: He didn’t disappear.
</p>

<p>
He was walking with me through all of it—the silence, the wreckage, the grief, the confusion. He never left. He never stopped loving me. He was just letting the ground beneath me break apart… so He could rebuild it the right way.
</p>

<p>
It was in that season of complete brokenness—while I was sitting in counseling, trying to make sense of the mess—that the phrase <strong>Healing MY Story</strong> came to me. Not someone else's story. <em>My</em> story. Because I needed healing. I needed to face the wounds I’d been carrying. And I needed to be reminded that healing wasn’t a theory. It was a promise.
</p>

<p>
And that’s where the calling shifted.
</p>

<p>
Writing wasn’t just something I did. It became something God used—to help me, and now to help others. He was preparing me… not for a platform, but for people. For you. For the pain you’re walking through. For the healing He wants to bring in your story.
