<h3>What's your God Story (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">Wherever you are in your journey, your story matters. Not just because it’s unique to you—but because it’s the foundation of where we begin. Healing isn’t a one-size-fits-all process. It’s deeply personal. And understanding your God Story helps me meet you right there, without judgment or pressure, and with complete honesty and compassion.</p>
<p class="">This step is crucial because everything we do in this process centers on Him. He is the Healer. I’m just a guide—a witness to your story, a coach to walk with you, and a partner in helping you uncover what’s been buried or broken so He can begin restoring what’s been lost.</p>
<p class="">Sharing your God Story is not about performance or perfection. It’s about truth. It’s about beginning the healing process from the most honest place possible—right where you are. When you can name your God Story, even if it’s messy or uncertain, you’re opening the door for Him to meet you there…and do what only He can do.</p>
<p class="">So, what’s your God Story?</p>
