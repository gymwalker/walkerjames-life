  <h2>Prayer Doesn’t Have to Be Complicated</h2>
  <p>Many people feel overwhelmed when it comes to prayer — unsure of what to say, how to say it, or even if they’re doing it “right.” But here’s the truth:</p>
  <p><strong>God doesn’t grade your words. He hears your heart.</strong></p>
  
  <p>There’s no script for prayer. You don’t have to say it “just right.” What matters is your heart — genuine, humble, open. Prayer isn’t about performance — it’s about connection. Whether you're praying for the first time, finding your way back to it, or your a professional, you don’t have to do it alone.</p>
  
  <p>That’s why we’re creating a Guided Prayer space — a growing collection of prayers to help you begin. From grief to gratitude, trauma to trust, these prayers are crafted to help you connect with God in whatever place you’re in.</p>

  <p><strong>Some of the most requested themes include:</strong><br>
  Grief • Anxiety • Addiction • Forgiveness • Identity • Marital Struggles • Trauma • Doubt • Thanksgiving • Surrender</p>

  <p>If you don’t see what you need yet, don’t worry — you can still reach out. Just fill in the prayer request below and include a note like:<br>
  <em>"I need help praying for..."</em><br>
  We’ll walk with you, lift your request to God, and keep creating more resources to serve you.</p>

  <p><strong>Scripture Reminder:</strong><br>
  <em>"Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."</em><br>
  —Romans 8:26 (ESV)</p>
