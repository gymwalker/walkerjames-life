<h3>Identity in Christ (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">You need to know what God says about you. Not what your trauma says. Not what others called you. Not what your past whispers to you in the dark. Not who the World thinks you are. But what <em>He</em> declares:</p>
<p class="">You are <strong>loved</strong>, <strong>chosen</strong>, <strong>redeemed</strong>, <strong>forgiven</strong>, <strong>called</strong>, <strong>secure</strong>, and <strong>sealed</strong> in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="">Together, through Scripture, prayer, conversation, and Spirit-led reflection, we’ll begin to rebuild this foundation—stone by stone, truth by truth. This is more than positive thinking. It’s about <strong>rooting your identity in the unshakable promises of God.</strong></p>
<p class="">You’ll learn what belongs to you as a child of the King: peace, authority, access, power, belonging, and freedom. These aren’t distant theological ideas. They are <strong>your inheritance</strong>—your Kingdom birthrights.</p>
<p class="">Because here’s the truth: <strong>you are not just near the Kingdom—you are <em>inside</em> it.</strong></p>
<p class="">And everything outside of it—<strong>devils, demons, and all demonic forces—have no right to speak to you, accuse you, torment you, or touch you.</strong></p>
<p class="">You are a blood-bought citizen of the Kingdom of God, a child of the Living God, sealed by the Holy Spirit and hidden in Christ.</p>
<p class="">That’s the kind of authority you carry.<br /> That’s what it means to know who you are.<br /> And that’s why the enemy works so hard to make you forget.</p>
<p class="">As your guide, this part of the process helps me see how deeply those truths have (or haven’t) taken root in your life. Because spiritual warfare is real—and if you don’t know who you are in Christ, you’ll fight from fear instead of from victory.</p>
<p class="">We’re not rushing into battle. We’re reestablishing your position.<br /> Because freedom begins not with a fight—but with <strong>identity.</strong></p>
<p class="">This isn’t just a lesson—it’s a declaration. A turning point.<br /> You are not who your pain says you are.<br /> You are who Jesus says you are.<br /> And no one—not even the enemy—gets to rewrite that.</p>
<p class=""><em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. </em><em>—2 Corinthians 5:17 (ESV)</em></p>
<p class=""><strong>I am not what was done to me.</strong><br /><strong> I am not what I’ve done.</strong><br /><strong> I am who He says I am—</strong><br /><strong> Loved. Chosen. Redeemed. Secure.</strong><br /><strong> I am inside the Kingdom of God,</strong><br /><strong> And everything outside of it has no power over me.</strong><br /><strong> In Christ, I belong—and I am free, because He loved me enough to set me free!</strong></p>
