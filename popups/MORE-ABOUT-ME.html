And yet—by the grace of God—I’m still here.

Not because I’m strong or special. But because God is faithful. He refused to abandon me. He refused to forsake me. Jesus didn’t walk away when I wanted to quit. He met me in the exhaustion, the grief, and the silence. He carried me through the rubble of disappointment and the weight of shattered expectations. He showed me that my story. It wasn’t punishment—it was preparation.

And along the way—through every valley—He never left me alone. Just when I was ready to give up, He would send someone: a friend, a pastor, a counselor, a stranger… a sermon, a book, a message, a thought, an idea—right when I needed it most. A whisper from heaven through someone here on earth.

Maybe, just maybe, I’m that person for you right now. Maybe that’s why you’re here.

God was shaping something deeper in me. A new kind of strength. A new kind of trust. A new kind of surrender. And most of all—a new understanding of who He really is, and what He really wants.

Over the years, I’ve poured my heart into being a father, a servant, a truth-teller, and a listener. I’ve failed, I’ve repented, I've been forgiven, I’ve forgiven, and I’ve fought to keep my heart tender in a world that tried to harden it. I’ve learned that love—real love—isn’t a feeling. It’s a choice. And I’ve discovered what it means to love others without condition… even when that love isn’t returned.

Today, I’m an author, speaker, and Freedom Coach. But those are just titles. What I really am is a wounded healer. I don’t lead people because I’m perfect—I lead because I’ve been through it, and Jesus showed me the way out. Now I get to show others how to walk with Him through the pain, too. I know what it’s like to feel unseen, unsupported, unworthy, and unloved.

I know what it’s like to question God’s goodness—and to come out the other side not perfect, but transformed. Everything I do now—whether it’s writing, speaking, or one-on-one coaching—is about helping people fall more deeply in love with a mighty God.

A God who sees your story—even the parts no one else does. A God who can redeem what feels too far gone. A God who says, “You are still worth loving. You are so valuable. So precious to Me.”

If you’ve ever felt too broken to be whole again… too messed up to be used… too rejected to be chosen—you are welcome here. You’re not alone. You’re in the right place.

And it would be my honor to walk with you.
