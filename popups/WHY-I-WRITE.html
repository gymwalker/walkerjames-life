<h3>Why I Write...</h3>
<p>After saying yes, I wrote every single day for three years. The words poured out—raw, honest, sometimes painful. By the end, I had written over 270,000 words—enough for four books. It was overwhelming and deeply satisfying. I realized that when the Holy Spirit gets on a roll, you can’t shut Him up. I loved the process. It was a time of healing for me. But then I hit a wall.</p>
<p>Who was going to read a 270,000-word book from a first-time author? I didn’t know what to do with what I had written. That’s when God shifted the vision—from one massive book to a full series. He helped me break the manuscript into ten parts, each focused on a different truth. And on my oldest son’s birthday in January 2018, I released Book 1: What Does God Want?</p>
<p>But what came next wasn’t celebration—it was silence.</p>
<p>Marketing the book was much harder than writing it. I poured everything into it, but the response was… almost nothing. I felt like I had followed God's instructions, and yet He’d gone quiet. I was confused, frustrated, even angry. So I did what I’ve been known to do—I pitched a fit. A professional, full-blown, adult temper tantrum. And that’s when the bottom dropped out.</p>
<p>That’s when The Hard Season began…</p>
