<h2>Why the Perspectives Series…</h2>

<p>
The short answer? Because no one taught me these things when I was growing up Christian. Most of them I had to learn the hard way. You know, make the mistake by picking up stupid and playing with it! No one said, “Hey Walker, put down stupid, back away from stupid—you’ll get hurt if you don’t!”
</p>

<p>
The long answer? Well, that starts back when I was fifteen, almost sixteen years old—that’s when I gave my life to Christ. And like so many others, I was told the usual things: <em>Read your Bible. Pray. Go to church. And you’ll be fine.</em>
</p>

<p>
Understand, those things are tools. They’re not the goal or the objective. They help with what God wants, but they’re not what He actually <em>wants</em>. No one told me that.
</p>

<p>
No one told me that building a real relationship with God takes more than rules, regulations, and rituals—it takes surrender, trust, and truth. And no one taught me what all of that meant. So, when life got hard—when God gave me not one but two sons with special needs—everything in my faith collapsed. I didn’t have a foundation from which to stand. I didn't trust God, because trust wasn’t on the list. For that matter, I didn’t even know <em>how</em> to trust God—and I certainly didn’t understand how important it was.
</p>

<p>
I had memory verses, sure, but no anchor.
</p>

<p>
No one had taught me how to want what God wants. No one had ever shown me what that actually looked like—or why it was so important to invest in my relationship with God <em>personally</em>.
</p>

<p>
So now? That’s what I’m doing. That’s what this series is all about.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Perspectives</em> series isn’t just a bunch of books. It’s everything I’ve learned—usually the hard way—about what it means to walk with God, to hear Him, to trust Him, to wrestle with Him, and to stay when it would be easier to run. Understand, I'm not this smart, I had a lot of the Holy Spirit, pastors, teachers, authors, speakers mentor me along the way. Each book in the series walks you through the process of wanting what God wants, knowing what God wants, and investing in what God wants.

<em>Simple. Straightforward. Truth—in love.</em>
