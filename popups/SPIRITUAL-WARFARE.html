<h3>Spiritual Warfare (Continued...)</h3>
<p class="">And you were never meant to fight in your own strength.</p>
<p class="">Spiritual warfare is not a fringe idea. It’s a core reality of the Christian life—and Jesus didn’t leave us defenseless. The Word of God is clear: <em>we are in a war not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces of evil.</em> But here’s the good news: <strong>those forces are already defeated.</strong><br /> They just don’t want you to know it.</p>
<p class="">In this part of the process, we’ll walk through:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p class="">How the enemy works—subtly and aggressively</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class="">How to recognize spiritual attacks—discouragement, confusion, temptation, torment, accusation, and more</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p class="">How to fight back—using the authority Jesus gave you, grounded in Scripture, covered by His blood, and sealed by His Spirit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="">This isn’t about theatrics or fear. It’s about truth.</p>
<p class=""><strong>You have been given authority to trample over the works of darkness</strong> (Luke 10:19).<br /> <strong>You have spiritual armor (Ephesians 6).</strong></p>
<p class="">You have access to divine weapons—prayer, praise, worship, the Word of God, and the blood of Jesus—that tear down strongholds and push back the darkness.</p>
<p class="">And because you're <strong>inside the Kingdom</strong>, every demonic force is <em>outside</em> the boundary of your rightful territory. They don’t get to accuse you. They don’t get to define you. They don’t even get to speak without permission from the God who already declared you free.</p>
<p class="">As your guide, I’ll help you discern what’s natural and what’s spiritual—when you’re dealing with wounds from the past and when you’re under attack in the present. And if deliverance is needed, we’ll prepare for that together. Gently. Biblically. Thoroughly. Because sometimes, what you’re fighting isn’t just emotional—it’s spiritual. And Jesus came to set captives free.</p>
<p class="">This is not something to fear. It’s something to understand.<br /> Because when you know who you are <em>and</em> what you carry, <strong>the enemy has no chance. He's a defeated foe.</strong></p>
<p class=""><em>Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you. </em><em>—Luke 10:19 (ESV)</em></p>
<p class=""><strong>I am not afraid of the battle—</strong><br /><strong> Because I do not fight alone.</strong><br /><strong> I wear the armor of God,</strong><br /><strong> I speak with the authority of Jesus,</strong><br /><strong> And I walk in the victory of the Cross.</strong><br /><strong> The enemy is already defeated.</strong></p>
