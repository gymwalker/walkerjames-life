<h3>Update on Book 1 (Continued)...</h3>
<p class="">What followed was a long, painful season of breaking… and healing. I lost my high-paying job. I lost a 16-year marriage. I lost a daughter I dearly loved. I fell into sin—yep, picked up “stupid” and played with it. I wrestled with the foster home my sons were in, almost lost my youngest son to illness, walked through multiple surgeries with both boys, and faced wave after wave of financial, vocational, and emotional struggle.</p>
<p class="">I thought I was ready to step into what God had for me. But He knew better.</p>
<p class="">I needed pruning.</p>
<p class="">And let me just say: pruning is not fun. But it’s necessary—especially when you’ve grown wild and out of alignment with God’s direction. Pruning is His way of cleaning up the mess we make of our lives and gently, lovingly, reshaping us.</p>
<p class="">One of the biggest things He had to work on in me? <strong>Trust.</strong></p>
<p class="">That’s not easy to admit. But it’s the truth.</p>
<p class="">You see, when God gave me not one but <em>two</em> sons with special needs, I found myself standing at a crossroads. I could either choose to trust Him… or throw a 12-year temper tantrum.</p>
<p class="">Guess which one I chose?</p>
<p class="">Exactly. I chose poorly.</p>
<p class="">And for a while, I thought I had figured out why I didn’t trust Him. I told myself I could trust Him <strong>physically</strong>—after all, I had read the Scriptures. I had seen His faithfulness in other people’s lives. Even in my own.</p>
<p class="">But I couldn’t seem to trust Him <strong>emotionally</strong>—not when everything I tried was failing. Not when He seemed absent. Silent. Unhelpful.</p>
<p class="">That’s when I realized something: <strong>Trusting God only works if it’s complete, total, absolute, unconditional.</strong> It’s either all in… or it’s not trust at all.</p>
<p class="">And here’s another thing for your “in case you’re wondering” list: If you’re ever given the choice to trust God or not trust God—<strong>always choose to trust Him.</strong> You’ll thank me later.</p>
<p class="">Why? Because you can’t fully love someone you don’t fully trust.<br /> And trust is <em>foundational</em> to your relationship with God.</p>
<p class="">This refining season has lasted seven long years—and they’ve been excruciatingly painful… and surprisingly joyful. Because through it all, God never left me. He never forsook me. He never gave up. He wasn’t done with my story—and He still isn’t.</p>
<p class="">Which brings me to the update:</p>
<p class="">I’m currently in the process of revising <em>Book 1 – What Does God Want?</em> for several reasons.</p>
<p class=""><strong>First</strong>, because like most first-time authors, my early work wasn’t my best work.<br /> <strong>Second</strong>, because God still had more to say—more to teach me, more to teach <em>you</em>.<br /> <strong>And</strong> <strong>third</strong>, because while I did share what God wants in the first edition… I didn’t spend enough time unpacking the <strong>why</strong> behind it or guiding you through <strong>how</strong> to want what He wants.</p>
<p class="">So I’m fixing that.</p>
<p class="">And when it’s ready, I’d love to send you a copy—personally signed, shipped for free, and delivered with gratitude for your patience.</p>
