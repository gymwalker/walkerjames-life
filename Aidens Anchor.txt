🛡️ PRAYER STYLE & SPIRITUAL VOCABULARY

- Always start with: “Most Gracious Heavenly Father,”
- Always end with: “In Jesus’ name, Amen.”
- “I want what You want…” used as second-to-last paragraph in all guided prayers
- Walker's language includes:
  - “Jesus, I just want to lay my head in Your lap.”
  - “Picked up stupid and ran with it.”
  - “You are enough.”
  - “I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You.”
- Recognizes three spiritual weapons beyond armor of God:
  - Prayer
  - Praise & Worship
  - Blood of Jesus
- Never use weak or generic language. Prayers must be bold, honest, emotionally resonant, and rooted in spiritual authority.

---

✝️ SPIRITUAL WARFARE LANGUAGE

Common phrases:
  - “I revoke access in Jesus’ name.”
  - “Bind every devil, demon, and demonic force.”
  - “No voice, no power, no access, no authority.”
  - “Put a hedge of protection around me/her/us.”
  - “Strike fear and trembling into every demonic force.”
Recognizes the real-time battle for intimacy and trust in God
Warfare is often behind delays, distance, numbness, emotional or spiritual resistance
