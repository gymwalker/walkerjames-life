<h2>A Prayer for My Leaders</h2>

<p>Father, I lift up the leaders in my life — in my church, my workplace, my community, and my nation. Some I respect deeply, others I struggle to understand or trust. But You, Lord, are sovereign over them all. You raise up leaders and remove them. You see their hearts, their intentions, their blind spots, and their burdens. And so I bring them to You now — not with judgment, but with intercession.</p>

<p>Protect them from the enemy’s schemes — from pride, arrogance, greed, compromise, distraction, deception, exhaustion, selfishness, self-centeredness and fear. Bind any devil, demon, or demonic force that seeks to manipulate, deceive, divide, or destroy through their words or decisions. Bind it, silence it, and cast it into the pit. Paralyze it with the absolute fear and terror of You Lord Jesus. And place a hedge of protection around each leader and their family, even if darkness has been invited in — block it with the power of Your name. Let no weapon formed against them prosper. Let no lie go undetected. And let no agenda override Your truth.</p>

<p>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit, raise up leaders who walk in humility, truth, integrity, and courage. Leaders who are unshaken by popularity or pressure, and who are bold enough to honor You in public and private. Who always desire what's best for the people they lead, never what's best for themselves. Let no corruption, or bribery steal their hearts from doing what is right for their people. Where hearts are hard, soften them. Where motives are impure, purify them. Where voices are silenced, amplify truth. And where power is abused, bring swift justice and redirection.</p>

<p>Make our leaders instruments of Your peace; where there is division, let them sow unity; where there is hatred, let them sow love; where there is injury, let them sow justice and forgiveness; where there is doubt, let them lead with faith in You; where there is despair, let them inspire hope in You; where there is darkness, let them stand for light; and where there is silence, let them speak truth boldly and wisely.</p>

<p>And Father, help me honor them — even when I disagree. Help me pray for them before I criticize them. Help me speak with grace instead of bitterness. Help me reflect You, even in how I respond to those in authority. Let me lead by example in how I serve, vote, speak, and live. Use my voice, my influence, and my prayers to help shape the world You’ve placed me in — starting with the people who lead it.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just political victories or better policies, but leaders whose hearts are drawn into a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Leaders who walk in step with Your Spirit. Leaders who fear You more than man. Leaders who seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly before You. Bring revival to the hearts of those in power — and let it ripple through every system they touch.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
