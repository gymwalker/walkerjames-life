  <h3>ðŸŸ¦ Monday â€“ Focus and Foundation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, thank You for this new beginning. Help me start this week with the right mindset â€” focused, grounded, and surrendered to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Align my heart with Yours today. Let my priorities match Yours. Let me seek first Your Kingdom and righteousness in all I do.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, give me clarity â€” not just in my plans, but in my purpose. Help me see what matters most and not get lost in what doesnâ€™t.</li>
    <li>â–º Strengthen me to walk in obedience, even when itâ€™s hard. I donâ€™t want to just talk about trusting You â€” I want to live it out.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me start this week anchored in Your truth â€” not my feelings, not my fears, not the noise around me, but Your unshakable Word.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, teach me to steward my time well today. Show me what to say yes to â€” and what to release, so Iâ€™m not running on empty.</li>
    <li>â–º Protect my thoughts. Guard my heart. Let no bitterness take root, no fear take over, no lie go unchallenged.</li>
    <li>â–º Jesus, lead my decisions today. Donâ€™t let me move ahead of You â€” or lag behind. I want to walk in step with You.</li>
    <li>â–º Remind me that Iâ€™m not doing this week alone. You go before me, walk beside me, and live within me. I am not alone.</li>
    <li>â–º When challenges come, help me respond in faith â€” not frustration. Let my reactions reflect Your presence, not my pressure.</li>
    <li>â–º I give You my to-do list, my worries, my goals, and my insecurities. Use them all for Your glory, or strip them away if theyâ€™re in the way.</li>
    <li>â–º Fill my words with life today. Let me speak encouragement, truth, and kindness â€” even when Iâ€™m tempted to do otherwise.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me grace for the people around me. Patience for their imperfections. And humility to admit my own.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, set the tone for my week. Let Monday be a day of momentum â€” not dread. A day of worship â€” not worry.</li>
    <li>â–º Show me where Iâ€™ve grown complacent. Wake me up. Stir my spirit. Light a fresh fire in my heart for You.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, thank You for the gift of purpose. I am here for a reason. Let me live like thatâ€™s true â€” because it is.</li>
    <li>â–º I trust You with this week. Every meeting. Every moment. Every miracle I donâ€™t yet see. Itâ€™s all Yours, Lord. Lead me well.</li>
    <li>â–º Holy Spirit, sharpen my spiritual sensitivity. Let me notice Your nudges and follow them quickly.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me build this day on the Rock â€” not on sand. Let every choice I make rest on the foundation of Your Word.</li>
    <li>â–º Guard my morning from distraction and my evening from discouragement. Bookend my day with Your peace.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, renew my mind today. Rewire anxious thoughts, break cycles of negativity, and flood me with the mind of Christ.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me faith to take the first step today â€” even if I canâ€™t see the whole path. Your presence is enough.</li>
    <li>â–º Teach me how to begin again â€” not with guilt, but with grace. Every Monday is a mercy, every breath a gift.</li>
    <li>â–º Anchor my emotions in You today. Let joy rise where thereâ€™s stress, and peace settle where thereâ€™s pressure.</li>
