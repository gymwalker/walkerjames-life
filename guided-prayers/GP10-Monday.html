  <h3>ðŸŸ¦ Monday â€“ Worship and Adoration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, You are holy, You are worthy, and You are the Creator of everything. I worship You because You are good and Your love never ends.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, You are my strength and my song. Even when I have nothing left to give, I can lift my voice to honor You.</li>
    <li>â–º I give You glory today, not because everything is perfect, but because You are perfect, and You are with me.</li>
    <li>â–º I praise You for Your mercy â€” fresh every morning. I didnâ€™t earn it. I donâ€™t deserve it. But You offer it anyway. Thank You.</li>
    <li>â–º God, You are my rock â€” unshakable, unmovable, and completely trustworthy. When everything else is uncertain, You are not.</li>
    <li>â–º I stand in awe of who You are. No one compares to You. Nothing even comes close. You are above all things and hold all things together.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for being near â€” not far, not distant. You draw close to those who draw near to You. And I want to be close to You today.</li>
    <li>â–º Jesus, I worship You not just with my words but with my life. Let everything I do today point to You and reflect Your goodness.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, even when I donâ€™t feel like worshipping â€” when Iâ€™m tired, stressed, or overwhelmed â€” I choose to praise You because You are still worthy.</li>
    <li>â–º I want my heart to overflow with gratitude. Not just for what You do, but for who You are. You are my God, and I love You.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for never changing. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. I can rely on You â€” completely.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, let my worship be real. Not just a habit or a song, but a connection â€” a response to Your love that flows from my heart.</li>
    <li>â–º I praise You for the beauty of creation â€” for every sunrise, every breath, every detail that reminds me You are present and powerful.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me start this week with my eyes fixed on You â€” not on my problems, not on my to-do list, but on the One who holds it all together.</li>
    <li>â–º You deserve more than a passing glance. You deserve all of me â€” my time, my attention, my devotion. So I offer myself again today.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, let worship soften my heart. Let it make me more aware of You â€” and more in love with You than I was yesterday.</li>
    <li>â–º You are worthy of my trust, my praise, and my surrender. You are God â€” and You are good. I honor You today and always.</li>
    <li>â–º Holy Spirit, breathe new life into my worship. Stir my soul again. Let the fire of adoration never go out.</li>
    <li>â–º Even if today holds struggles or sorrow, let praise be my posture. Let worship be my weapon. Let gratitude be my heartbeat.</li>
    <li>â–º This day is Yours. This heart is Yours. This life is Yours. Be glorified in it all. I love You, Lord. I worship You.</li>
