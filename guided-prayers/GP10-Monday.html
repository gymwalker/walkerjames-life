    <li>â–º Jesus, what do You want to accomplish in and through me? What changes in my character, relationships, and leadership do You want to make? What goals do You have for me?

    <li>â–º Thank You for answering my prayers, for listening to me and taking my prayers seriously and for responding to me.</li>

    <li>â–º Help me to see You actively answering my prayers. Use my prayers for healing to help others fall more in love with You and appreciate You.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for responding to me...not because of who I am but because of who You are.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me to give the best, the finest I have to You today and always.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me to never misrepresent You or Your Holiness.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me always be quick to listen and slow to speakâ€”in work, in conversations, and in relationships. Help me take the time needed to ponder what Iâ€™m about to say. Empower me with Your Spirit so that I will say the things You want me to say in the manner You want me to say them.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, speak to me. I am ready to listen and eager to learn and obey. Help me to obey every word You speak to me.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, I want to learn, obey, and trustâ€”but itâ€™s hard sometimes. Help me to be better at learning, trusting, and obeying You. Help me be content in You and with You, and to never murmur against what Youâ€™re doing or allowing in my life.</li>
    <li>â–º May Your will be done in my life. Help me to cooperate with You and Your will for me.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, send out workers into Your harvest to reap bountifully...send me. I make myself available to You.</li>

    <li>â–º Father, help me set my heart on seeking and finding You today and every day...to seek You and Your Kingdom...to desire time with You, to make time for You...to stay in Your presence all day long.</li>
    <li>â–º Forgive me of my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me to always wait on You, to seek first Your Kingdom, and to seek Your guidance and counsel before I do anything. Help me to keep my focus on loving and serving You, honoring and glorifying You, and being obedient to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, donâ€™t let anything block Your Love or Your Glory from shining in and through my life and heart.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord Jesus, help me to carry Your cross each day and to never be ashamed of it.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me to take my focus off of myself, my problems, and my strugglesâ€”and instead focus on serving others and glorifying You and Your Kingdom.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me to pour all my energy into serving You and Your Kingdom.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me to see my small problems in light of how GREAT You are. May I hold them up against You and recognize that they are nothing in comparison.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, I donâ€™t just want to be filled with Your Spiritâ€”I want Your Spirit to consume me, to rule and reign over me and my flesh, so I may be a perfect reflection of Your Son Jesus.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, help me trust You completely, obey You always, and faithfully prepare for all that Youâ€™ve called me to do.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, You have permission to do any spiritual surgery You deem necessary on my heart, soul, or flesh. I am willing to throw away anything in my life that doesnâ€™t please You. Help me to add the things that do.</li>
    <li>â–º Keep me from daydreaming while talking with You. Strengthen my mind and help me stay focused on our time together. Help me appreciate this time with You.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me to stay awake and alert while talking to You. Keep me from getting drowsy or distracted.</li>
    <li>â–º Put a shield of protection around me, my life, my family, and my mindâ€”that the enemy cannot penetrate or influence in any way.</li>
    <li>â–º Bind the enemy and keep them from interfering with me, my thoughts, my day, my loved ones, and my relationship with You and others.</li>
