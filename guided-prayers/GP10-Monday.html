  <h3>🟦 Monday – Focus and Foundation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, thank You for this new day, this new week, this new beginning. Help me start this week with the right mindset — focused, grounded, and surrendered to and on You.</li>
    <li>► Align my heart with Yours today. Let my priorities match Your priorities. Let me seek first Your Kingdom and Your righteousness in all I do.</li>
    <li>► Lord, give me clarity — not just in my plans, but in my purpose. Help me see what matters most and not get lost in what doesn’t.</li>
    <li>► Strengthen me to walk in obedience, even when it’s hard. I don’t want to just talk about trusting You — I want to live it out, trusting You in all things. Fully surrendered to You in all things.</li>
    <li>► Help me start this week consuming Your truth so that I am anchored in Your truth — not my feelings, not my fears, not the noise around me, but Your unshakable Word of Truth.</li>
    <li>► Lord, teach me to steward my time well today and all week long. Show me what to say yes to — and what to release, so I’m not running on empty, and so I don't pickup brudens you don't want me to carry.</li>
    <li>► Protect my thoughts. Guard my heart. Let no bitterness take root, no fear take over, no lie go unchallenged.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, lead my decisions today. Don’t let me move ahead of You — or lag behind. I want to walk in step with You.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that I’m not doing this week alone. You go before me, walk beside me, and live within me. I am not alone, facing whatever You have in this day together.</li>
    <li>► When challenges come, help me respond in faith — not frustration. Let my reactions reflect Your presence, not my pressure. Encourage me to give grace freely.</li>
    <li>► I give You my to-do list, my worries, my goals, and my insecurities. Use them all for Your glory, or strip them away if they’re in the way, and do not glorify You.</li>
    <li>► Fill my words with life today. Let me speak encouragement, truth, and kindness — even when I’m tempted to do otherwise.</li>
    <li>► Give me grace for the people around me. Patience for their imperfections. And humility to admit my own.</li>
    <li>► Lord, set the tone for my week. Let Monday be a day of momentum — not dread. A day of worship — not worry.</li>
    <li>► Show me where I’ve grown complacent. Wake me up. Stir my spirit. Light a fresh fire in my heart for You, and for others.</li>
    <li>► Father, thank You for the gift of purpose. I am here for a reason. Let me live like that’s true — because it is.</li>
    <li>► I trust You with this week. Every meeting. Every moment. Every miracle I don’t yet see. It’s all Yours, Lord. Lead me well.</li>
    <li>► Holy Spirit, sharpen my spiritual sensitivity. Let me notice Your nudges and respond as You would have me.</li>
    <li>► Help me build this day on the Rock — not on sand. Let every choice I make rest on the foundation of Your Word.</li>
    <li>► Guard my morning from distraction and my evening from discouragement. Bookend my day with Your peace.</li>
    <li>► Lord, renew my mind today. Rewire anxious thoughts, break cycles of negativity, and flood me with the mind of Christ.</li>
    <li>► Give me faith to take the first step today — even if I can’t see the whole path. You are enough, Lord.</li>
    <li>► Teach me how to begin again — not with guilt, but with grace. Every day is a mercy, every breath a gift.</li>
    <li>► Anchor my emotions in You today. Let joy rise where there’s stress, and peace settle where there’s pressure.</li>
