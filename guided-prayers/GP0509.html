<h2>A Prayer for After the Breakthrough</h2>

<p>God, You came through. You answered. You moved. You made a way. And before I do anything else, I want to run back to you and say what the one leper said — thank You. Thank You for hearing me, for helping me, for healing what was broken, for moving mountains I couldn’t move myself. Thank You for being faithful, even in the waiting, even in the silence, even when I doubted.</p>

<p>So often I pray hard when I’m desperate… and then move on quickly when the breakthrough comes. But I don’t want to do that with You. I don’t want to treat Your provision as ordinary or forget the miracle in the middle of the blessing. This answer came from You. This breakthrough bears Your fingerprints. And I want to mark this moment — not just with relief, but with rejoicing, with praise, with worship.</p>

<p>I praise You not just for what You did, but for how You loved me through it. For all the unseen ways You carried me. For the strength You gave me when I didn’t know I had any left. For the people You sent to encourage me. For the quiet reminders that You were still there. I see it all more clearly now — and I give You all the credit, all the glory, all the praise.</p>

<p>Teach me how to steward this breakthrough well. Help me not to drift from You now that the storm has passed. Help me build on this answered prayer — to trust You more, to worship You deeper, to walk closer, to live more boldly. Let this become a cornerstone in my story — a memory that fuels my faith for whatever comes next. And help me share the story — not to draw attention to myself, but to point others to You.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a breakthrough, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that celebrates every answered prayer as a doorway into deeper trust. One that holds onto You, not just when I need something, but when I’ve already received it — and want nothing more than to stay close to You.</p>

<p>Thank You for the breakthrough. Thank You for Your love. Thank You for always being faithful — even when I forget to notice.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
