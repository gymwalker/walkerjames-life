<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Overwhelmed</h2>

<p>Father, I’m overwhelmed. It feels like the weight of everything is pressing down at once — responsibilities, expectations, fears, disappointments, and unspoken worries I can’t even put into words. My mind is racing. My chest is tight. My heart feels heavy. And I don’t know where to start, what to fix, or even how to pray. It’s too much… and I need You. I need Your presence. I need Your peace. I need Your comfort.</p>

<p>You said to cast my burdens on You, so here I am, casting away — all of them. The ones that make me anxious. The ones I’ve tried to carry alone. The ones You've never asked me to carry. The ones that whisper lies about who I am and what I’m capable of. I give You my mess, my fear, my confusion, my to-do lists, my not-enoughs, and my “what ifs.” I give You the people I can’t fix, the problems I can’t solve, and the outcomes I can’t control.</p>

<p>Jesus, remind me that I don’t have to be everything to everyone. That You didn’t ask me to carry the world — You already did that on the cross. You invited me to come to You, to rest in You, to follow You — not to outrun You and Your grace trying to do it all myself. Help me slow down. Breathe. Let go. Trust. Show me what’s mine to carry and what was never meant for me.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, calm the chaos inside me. Speak peace into the storm of my thoughts. Silence the voice of the enemy that says, “You’ll never make it,” “You’re failing,” or “You’re alone.” I reject those lies in the name of Jesus. I claim Your truth instead — that You are with me, You are for me, and You are greater than everything coming against me. Place a hedge of protection around me and my mind. Bind every devil, demon, or demonic force trying to stir confusion, exhaustion, or fear. Shut down their interference. I revoke their access in Jesus’ name — and invite You to rule and reign instead.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just relief, but renewal. Not just peace for the moment, but peace that surpasses all understanding. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that steadies me when life swirls around me. Let my overwhelmed heart find rest in Your unwavering presence. You are my anchor. You are my calm. You are enough.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
