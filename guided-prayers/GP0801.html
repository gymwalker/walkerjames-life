<h2>A Prayer for When You Have No Words</h2>

<p>Father… I don’t even know what to say right now. My heart is full — or maybe it’s just heavy — but I can’t seem to form the words. I try to pray, but nothing comes out. I’m overwhelmed. Exhausted. Confused. Frustrated. Tired. Or maybe just empty. And even though I can’t find the words, I know You’re still here. I know You’re still listening.</p>

<p>Your Word says that even when I can’t speak, the Spirit intercedes for me with groanings too deep for words. So I lean into that now. I trust that You know my heart better than I do. You know what I need. You know what I’m afraid to ask for. You know what is occupying my thoughts. You not what I'm worried about. You know why I'm anxious. You know why I'm afriad. You know what’s buried beneath the silence. And You’re not frustrated with me — You’re drawing closer still. Thank you for Your patience.</p>

<p>I don’t have a polished prayer today, Lord. I don’t have poetic language or clear requests. I just have this moment — and a soul that still wants You, even if it’s too tired to chase You. So I bring You my silence, my sighs, my tears, and my need. And I trust that it’s enough.</p>

<p>Remind me, Father, that I’m not alone in this. That You’re with me in the silence. That You’re working even when I can’t see it. That prayer isn’t about performance — it’s about presence. It's all about relationship. And right now, I choose to be present with You, even if all I can do is sit still and breathe. Put my head in Your lap and cry. Lay here and just hold You tight.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just clarity or answers, but connection. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that doesn’t depend on the right words, but on the right heart. And right now, my heart is open. Come meet me here in the quiet. You’re all I need. You're all I want. You are enough.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
