<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Numb</h2>

<p>Father, I know I should feel something… but I don’t. Not joy. Not peace. Not sadness. Not even anger. Just this strange, heavy silence inside. It’s like everything is muted — my emotions, my passion, my connection to You, and even my connection to myself. And I don’t know how I got here. Maybe it’s the weight of everything. Maybe it’s just too much for too long. But I’m tired of pretending I’m okay when I’m not. I feel numb… and I don’t want to stay this way.</p>

<p>I miss feeling close to You. I miss the warmth of Your presence and the spark of hope that used to keep me going. I know You haven’t moved — that You’re still here — but right now, I feel so disconnected. And I hate that. But even in this numbness, I choose to reach for You. I choose to believe You’re still holding me, still loving me, even when I can’t feel it.</p>

<p>Jesus, help me feel again. Not just emotions — but truth. Love. Grace. Conviction. Joy. Awe. Help me believe that I’m not broken beyond repair. That this numbness isn’t forever. That You’re doing something inside me even now — thawing what’s frozen, waking up what’s gone quiet, breathing life into what feels dead.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, stir something deep within me. Whisper when I can’t hear. Nudge me when I won’t move. Fill the empty places with Your presence. Remind me that I’m still Yours — even when I feel distant, flat, and hollow. Speak truth over the lies I’ve believed — that I’m too far gone, too tired, too unworthy to feel anything again. I reject that in Jesus’ name.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just emotions, but renewal. Not just relief, but revival. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — even if it starts right here, in the numbness. Bring the right people, the right voices, the right Scriptures, the right worship to awaken my heart again. To awaken my very soul again. I trust You to meet me here… and to lead me out. Until then, I'm just going to rest my head on Your lap Jesus and pray that You help me feel Your love and grace once again.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
