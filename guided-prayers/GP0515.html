<h2>A Prayer of Gratitude in the Middle of the Storm</h2>

<p>God, I thank You — even here, even now, even in the middle of this storm. The winds are howling, the waves are rising, and the sky feels dark, but I choose gratitude. Not because life is easy, but because You are with me. Because You never leave. Because You are still God, still good, still faithful, no matter what swirls around me.</p>

<p>I don’t always understand why the storm is here. I don’t know how long it will last or how it will end. But I know this: You are in the boat with me. You haven’t abandoned me. You haven’t forgotten me. And even if You don’t calm the storm just yet, I know You can calm my heart in the middle of it. So I thank You — for Your presence, for Your peace, for Your promises that hold me steady when everything else shakes.</p>

<p>Thank You for giving me breath today. Thank You for the strength to keep going. Thank You for reminders of Your goodness — even if they’re small and quiet. A kind word. A moment of beauty. A verse that speaks to my soul. You are here. You are speaking. You are working — even when I can’t see it yet.</p>

<p>Help me to fix my eyes on You, not the storm. Help me to lift my voice in worship, even when my heart is heavy. Help me to declare Your goodness, not just when the clouds part, but while the thunder still rolls. Let my praise rise in the middle — not just after the breakthrough, but before. Because You are worthy, and You are with me, and that is enough.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just rescue, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I learn to trust You in the dark. One where gratitude becomes my anchor, even when answers don’t come. One where I know that Your presence is my greatest gift — and that You never waste a storm.</p>

<p>Thank You for being my refuge, my strength, my song — even here, even now, even in this storm.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
