<h2>A Prayer for Authority in Jesus’ Name</h2>

<p>Most Gracious Heavenly Father, I come before You in the name that is above every name — Jesus Christ, my Savior, my Redeemer, my Lord, and my King. You have given all authority in heaven and on earth to Him, and by Your grace, I now carry that authority as one who belongs to Him. Not by my merit, not by my works, but first because I have been chosen by You, in return I too have chosen You, but most importantly by the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony — I stand and declare that I have authority in Jesus’ name. Given to me by my King.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, I speak to the enemy and every dark force that has tried to intimidate, distract, or delay me — and I say: *get behind me satan. You have no place, no claim, no power, no hold.* The authority I carry is not mine — it is His. And because Jesus lives in me, the same power that raised Him from the dead now lives in me. That power is holy. That power is unmatched. That power is unstoppable.</p>

<p>I have authority over fear — and I command it to leave.  
I have authority over anxiety — and I silence its voice.  
I have authority over shame — and I reject its hold.  
I have authority over every spirit of darkness — and I declare it must flee.  
I have authority to speak life, to declare truth, to break strongholds, to loose chains, to bind up lies, and to tear down everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus, You said that whatever I bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever I loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. So right now, I bind every devil, demon, and demonic voice, influence, and attack — and I loose the peace of God, the truth of Your Word, and the power of the Holy Spirit over my life and everything connected to me. I am not helpless. I am not confused. I am not weak. I am authorized. I am covered. I am called.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, help me to wield this authority with humility, wisdom, and clarity. Let me never use it for my glory, but only for Yours. Let me walk as one who knows who they are — not because of title, position, or appearance, but because I belong to Jesus, the King of Kings. I am submitted to You, and because I’m submitted to You, I can resist the enemy — and he must flee.</p>

<p>I want what You want Lord — to walk in the full authority of the Kingdom of God, not as a bystander, but as a warrior, a bond-servant (a servant by choice), and a friend of Jesus Christ. I want to passionately desire a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — where every word I speak carries Your weight, and every step I take is grounded in Your truth.</p>

<p>I declare that I walk in the authority of Jesus Christ — today, tomorrow, and forever. Not in pride. Not in fear. But in power, in purpose, and in perfect alignment with You and Your truth.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
