<h2>A Prayer for a New Identity in Christ</h2>

<p>Father, I’m tired of living under old names. Names I didn’t choose, but ones I accepted — failure, broken, rejected, unworthy, unwanted, unloved, not enough, not good enough. Some came from what others said, some came from my own mistakes, and some… I think came straight from the enemy. But none of them came from You. And I’m ready to lay them all down. I’m ready for something new. I’m ready to believe who You say I am in Christ Jesus. Beloved, adored, adopted, valued, treasured, a Child of the Living God.</p>

<p>Jesus, thank You for redefining me at the cross. When You died and rose again, You didn’t just forgive my sin — You threw it as far as the east is from the west and You gave me a new name. You called me beloved. Redeemed. Whole. Chosen. Forgiven. Free. And I confess that I haven’t always lived like that’s true. I’ve kept wearing the labels of my past. I’ve let shame write the narrative. I’ve let fear control the way I see myself. I let failure define my potential. But not anymore.</p>

<p>Right now, I break agreement with every lie I’ve believed about who I am. I renounce the voices that said I’ll never change, never matter, never belong. I reject the shame, the fear, the failure, the guilt, the regret, and the hopelessness. And I receive what You’re offering instead — truth, identity, confidence, healing, freedom, joy, and a brand-new name.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, renew my mind. Rewire my thoughts. Help me see myself through Your eyes — loved, adored, called, chosen, covered, and commissioned. Let me walk in the authority that comes from being a child of the King. Help me speak about myself the way You speak about me. No more self-hate. No more small thinking. No more letting the past define what You’ve already redeemed.</p>

<p>I truly want what You want… not just a better version of the old me, but a brand-new identity in Christ. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that anchors me in truth and carries me into purpose. I am who You say I am. And I choose to live like it, starting right now. Thank you for Your love, mercy, grace, and power that allows me to walk a new with You.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
