<h2>A Prayer for My Marriage</h2>

<p>God, I bring my marriage to You — every part of it. The places that are strong and the places that feel fragile. The joy, the frustration, the laughter, the distance, the intimacy. You see it all, and You care about it more than we realize. You designed this covenant to reflect Your love — but sometimes it feels so far from that. Sometimes it feels like a burden. Sometimes we don’t know how to fix what’s broken. Sometimes we don’t even know where to start.</p>

<p>So I come to You, humbly and honestly. Heal what needs healing. Restore what’s been lost. Bring back the unity, the tenderness, the intimacy, the desire to fight for one another instead of with one another. Help us each to learn how to Love what the other person Loves. To take an interest in thier passions and desires, not just focus on our own. I know this doesn't mean we have to like what they like, but it does mean we have to love what they love, because they love it, and we love them. So, we should automatically love what they love. Teach us how to serve each other with patience and grace. Abudant, overwhelming, grace. Help us stop keeping score. Help us forgive — really forgive. Show us how to build trust again where it’s been worn thin.</p>

<p>When the words don’t come easily, help us choose kindness. When the pressure builds, help us hold onto peace. And when we feel like giving up, remind us why we said “yes” in the first place. Re-center us in You. Let our marriage be built on more than feelings — let it be grounded in faith, commitment, and a love that chooses to stay, even when its difficult. Help us to continue to, and always choose each other, each and every day.</p>

<p>Surround us with wise voices and godly counsel. Bring the right people, the right books, the right messages to speak life and Your truth into our relationship. Protect us from anything that seeks to divide what You’ve brought together. And show us where we need to grow — as a spouse, a listener, a servant, a partner. Help me become the person my spouse needs, and the reflection of Your love they deserve. In kind, help my spouse become the person I need, and the reflection of Your love that I deserve.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just peace, but a marriage that leads both of us into a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. I want restoration that runs deeper than circumstances — restoration of hearts, minds, unity, purpose, and joy. If our love is to mirror Yours, then teach us to love like You — sacrificially, patiently, faithfully, without condition. And when we forget how, remind us that You are always near, and You are always enough.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
