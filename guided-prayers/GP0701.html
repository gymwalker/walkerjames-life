<h2>A Prayer to Return to God</h2>

<p>Father, I miss You. I haven’t said that out loud in quite a while, but I feel it deep down in my soul. Somewhere along the way, I drifted — slowly at first, then further than I ever meant to go. Maybe it was sin. Maybe it was distraction. Maybe it was pain or disappointment that made me pull away. Maybe it was some shiny object the world was showing me and I chased it. But whatever the reason, I know this: I’m tired of running. I’m tired of pretending. And I want to come home. Honestly, I want what You have always wanted, a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with me. And it seems like I've been a bit to selfish, self-centered, and self-absorbed. I've been too busy doing all the things that interfere with my relationship with You rather than focusing on the things that will invest in my relationship with You.</p>

<p>You never stopped loving me. Not for a second. Even when I ignored You. Even when I knew better and chose my own way. You didn’t leave — I did, I know this, and I am truly grateful for that. But You’ve never stopped waiting for me to return either. Watching. Hoping. Whispering. And now, I hear You calling me back — not with guilt or shame, but with grace. Not with condemnation, but with kindness.</p>

<p>So here I am, Lord. I don’t have perfect words. I don’t have a shiny track record. I don't feel worthy. But I have a heart that’s ready to turn around. I have a soul that misses You. I want to be close again. I want to hear Your voice. I want to walk with You like I used to — and even better than before. I want to fully invest in my relationship with You. I don’t want surface-level faith. I want something real, raw, and holy. Something that lasts.</p>

<p>Wash me clean, Father. Forgive the distance. Heal what’s broken. Restore what I’ve lost. Teach me again how to trust You — how to rest in Your love and walk in Your truth. I don’t want to go through the motions anymore. I want to live like someone who’s been rescued, restored and transformed — because I have been.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a reunion, but restoration. I want to passionately desire a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. I want to know You again — not just as my Savior, but as my Father, my Friend, my Shepherd, my Lord, my Master, my King. Thank You for never giving up on me. I’m coming home — and I don’t want to leave again. Keep me in Your peace, and Your loving arms, always!</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
