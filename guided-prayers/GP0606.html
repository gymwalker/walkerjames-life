<h2>A Prayer for My Son</h2>

<p>Father, thank You for the gift of my son. What a privilege, what an honor, it is to be part of his story — to watch him grow, stumble, laugh, question, stretch, and become who You are calling him to be. You see his full potential even when I only see glimpses. You know the battles he’ll face, the wounds he’ll carry, and the purpose You’ve placed inside him. And I entrust him to You — again and again — because You love him even more than I do.</p>

<p>I pray You would shape him into a man after Your own heart — not just strong, but surrendered. Not just successful, but faithful. Not just admired, but deeply rooted in truth. Teach him how to walk humbly and lead boldly. Give him courage to stand for what is right, even when it costs him. Let integrity define his character, and compassion mark his choices. Show him what real strength looks like — the kind that protects, uplifts, and serves.</p>

<p>Help me, Father, to raise him wisely. Let my words build him up, not tear him down. Let my discipline be rooted in love, not control. And let my presence teach him more about Your presence than any lecture ever could. Show me how to help him become the man You created him to be — not the one I might imagine, but the one You designed. Teach me how to correct with grace, guide with wisdom, and release with faith as he grows into his own calling.</p>

<p>Help me invest my time into him intentionally — to be present, available, and engaged. Let me never take these years for granted. I don’t want to miss the windows You’ve given me to pour truth into his life, to point him to You in everyday conversations, and to show him that following You isn’t just a rule — it’s a pleasure, it's a joy. Let the way I live make him want to know the God I love so deeply.</p>

<p>And Lord, give me discernment in how I help him choose his friends. Let me recognize the voices that influence him — the ones that build or tear down, lead to wisdom or pull toward foolishness. Give him eyes to see what’s real, what’s honorable, and what honors You. Bless him with friends who speak life, who stir up faith, and who make it easier for him to follow You — not harder.</p>

<p>Help me to guard his heart from the distractions and traps of this world — social media, pornography, comparison, lust, pride, laziness, and performance. Help me give him the tools to resist what would destroy him, and to choose what will grow him. And when he’s tempted to pick up stupid, give him the wisdom and strength to put it down. Remind him that his worth doesn’t come from achievement, appearance, or approval, but from being Your son.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a son who’s safe and successful, but a young man who walks and desires a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Let him be a man of prayer, a man of conviction, a man of grace and truth. Bring the right people, the right words, the right moments, and the right calling into his life — and help me walk with him faithfully, humbly, and full of love, every step of the way, supporting You in what You've called him to do.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
