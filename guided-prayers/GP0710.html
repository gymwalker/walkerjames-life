<h2>A Prayer to Restore What Was Lost</h2>

<p>Father, You are the God who restores. You see what I’ve lost — what was stolen, what was broken, what I gave away too easily, or what slipped through my fingers when I wasn’t looking. You see the time I can’t get back, the people who left, the words I can’t unsay, the opportunities I missed, those that I've hurt, and the damage that was done. And yet… You don’t just see loss — You see redemption. You see possibilities. You see opportunity. You see what can be rebuilt. You see what can rise from ashes. And I need that kind of hope right now. Help me to see what You see.</p>

<p>Some of what I lost was because of others… and some was because of me. My sin. My decisions. My delays. My pride. My rebellion. My pain. And I bring it all to You — not to hide it, but to surrender it. I don’t want to live stuck in regret or what-ifs. I want to live in the promise of what You can do with a surrendered life. You are the Restorer of my soul, the Rebuilder of ruins, the One who makes all things new. And nothing is too broken for You to heal.</p>

<p>God, I’m asking You to do what only You can do. Restore what was lost. Redeem what was wasted. Rebuild what was torn down. Rekindle what once felt dead. And renew what I thought was gone forever. Bring beauty from the brokenness. Purpose from the pain. Wisdom from the wounds. Use every part of my story — even the chapters I’d rather forget — and write something redemptive, something eternal, something that glorifies You. Something that heals and transforms my life.</p>

<p>And Father, help me let go of what You’ve asked me to release — the things You don’t want me to carry into this next season. Not everything lost needs to be recovered. So give me discernment. Show me what to leave behind, what to pick up again, and what to rebuild differently — this time, with You at the center.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just recovery, but resurrection. Not just getting things back, but getting You back in the middle of everything. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that isn’t defined by what I’ve lost, but by what You’ve redeemed. You are the God of restoration, the God of transformation, and I trust You with every broken piece of my story. I believe it’s not over. Not even close.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
