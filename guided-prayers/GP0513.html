<h2>A Prayer of Gratitude for Restored Relationships</h2>

<p>God, thank You for being the Restorer. Thank You for mending what was broken, softening what was hardened, and healing what felt hopeless. Only You could bring reconciliation where there was once distance, peace where there was pain, and understanding where there was silence. I see Your hand in the healing — and I don’t take it for granted.</p>

<p>Thank You for the grace that made restoration possible — Your grace for me, and the grace You helped me extend to others. Thank You for working beneath the surface, even when I didn’t see change happening. Thank You for teaching me how to forgive, how to be humble, how to listen, how to love again. You made a way where there wasn’t one — and for that, I give You praise.</p>

<p>God, help me never forget the beauty of this restoration. Let me carry it with gratitude, not entitlement. Let me nurture what You’ve restored instead of taking it for granted. Help me to be intentional with the relationships You’ve renewed — to speak life, to extend grace, to protect peace, and to choose love every single day.</p>

<p>And for the relationships that are still hurting or still distant, thank You for reminding me that no situation is beyond Your reach. You are the God who brings prodigals home, who turns enemies into brothers, who takes bitter stories and rewrites them with redemption. Keep my heart soft, my prayers persistent, and my trust anchored in You.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just the return of what was lost, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I learn to love others the way You love me. One where reconciliation is a reflection of the Gospel. One where gratitude overflows from a heart touched by Your grace.</p>

<p>Thank You for restoring what I thought was too far gone. Thank You for proving that love is stronger than pain, that grace is greater than pride, and that You are always working to make all things new.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
