<h2>A Prayer for My Enemy</h2>

<p>Father, this one is hard, so hard. You know how deeply I’ve been hurt — the betrayal, the rejection, the injustice. You saw it happen. You heard what was said. You know what it cost me. So I’m not coming to You pretending I’m not wounded. I’m coming to You because I don’t want to carry the weight of anger, bitterness and hatred any longer. I don’t want unforgiveness to take root in my heart and interfere with my relationship with You. I want freedom — not just for me, but for them too.</p>

<p>You tell me to pray for my enemies, so I’m doing that now. Not because it’s easy — but because I trust You more than I trust my emotions. You are just. You are righteous. And You’re the only One who sees the whole story. So I place this person in Your hands. Heal what I can’t heal. Reach what I can’t reach. Work in ways I can’t control. If there is conviction they need, bring it. If there is brokenness they’re hiding, meet them in it. And if there is still hope for restoration or reconciliation, show us how to walk toward it — or how to release it.</p>

<p>Help me to forgive — not because they deserve it, but because You forgave me when I didn’t deserve it. Help me to forgive because it helps me to release all of that anger, bitterness, and hatred I've stored up inside of me against them. Help me to bless when I want to curse. To release when I want to hold on. And to be free even if they never apologize, change, or understand. You are my defender. You are my vindicator. And I can trust You with the outcome.</p>

<p>Protect me from our enemy (devils, demons, or demonic forces), when they come back and say "remember what this person said to you, did to you, don't you just hate that? Hate them?" Help me to respond with no, I've been forgiven by Jesus, and I've forgiven them because Jesus asked me to. So, no I don't hate them. Now be gone! Protect me from becoming hard, cynical, or closed off. Keep my heart soft. Don’t let what they did to me become what lives in me. I don’t want to be ruled by anger, fear, or self-righteousness. I want to be ruled by grace, grounded in truth, and overflowing with love — even when it’s costly.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not revenge, but redemption. Not bitterness, but breakthrough. Not pride, but peace. I want to live in a way that shows the world what Your mercy really looks like. Heal me from what they’ve done. Heal them from what they’ve become. And bring both of us into a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Even this — *especially* this — is Yours.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
