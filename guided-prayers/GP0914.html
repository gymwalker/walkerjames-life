<h2>A Prayer to Praise in the Middle of the Battle</h2>

<p>Most Gracious Heavenly Father, I lift my voice to You — not because everything is easy, but because **You are still worthy.** Right here, in the middle of the battle… with questions unanswered, with wounds still healing, with enemies still advancing — I choose praise. Not because I feel strong, but because **You are strong.** Not because I see the way through, but because **You are the way, the truth and the life.** Not because the storm is over, but because **You are God in the storm.**</p>

<p>I won’t wait for the victory to sing. I won’t wait for the breakthrough to worship. I won’t wait until the enemy flees to lift my hands. Right now, in the heat of the fight, I lift a song. I raise a hallelujah in defiance of fear. I shout for joy in the face of pain. I declare Your goodness in the valley of the shadow of death, for I will fear NO evil. I may be surrounded — but so is my enemy. And **You have not left me. You never will.**</p>

<p>Lord Jesus, I praise You for who You are — not just what You do.  
I praise You for being faithful, even when I feel forgotten.  
I praise You for being present, even when I can’t see You.  
I praise You for Your mercy, when shame tries to speak louder.  
I praise You for Your promises, when lies come knocking.  
I praise You for the cross — the proof that no battle I face is bigger than the victory You’ve already won.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, help me worship when it’s hard.  
Help me lift my voice when I feel like shutting down.  
Help me remember that praise is a weapon — and it weakens the enemy every time I use it.  
Let worship rise from my spirit, not my circumstances. Let it shake the walls around me. Let it shift the atmosphere. Let it silence the lies. Let it bring Heaven’s presence into this very moment.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just peace after the battle, but praise *in* the battle. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that praises in the prison, worships in the wilderness, and trusts in the tension. You are my King. You are my Victory. And even in the middle of the war, I will worship You like it’s already won — because it is.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ powerful and matchless name, Amen.</p>
