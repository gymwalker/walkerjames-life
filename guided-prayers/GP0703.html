<h2>A Prayer After Falling into Sin</h2>

<p>Father… I messed up. Again. And right now, everything in me wants to hide — to pretend it didn’t happen, to minimize it, to numb it, or to run from it. But I know that’s not what You want. You want me to bring it to You. So here I am, God — broken, embarrassed, ashamed, convicted, and in desperate need of Your mercy and Your grace.</p>

<p>I hate that I gave in. I hate that I chose something I knew would hurt You, hurt me. Something that I know you find extremely offensive. It promised relief, excitement, comfort — but it left me empty, ashamed, and distant. And yet, even now, I know You haven’t left. You never walk away from me. You see my failure, and You still invite me back with open arms.</p>

<p>Forgive me, Lord. Not just for the action, but for the heart behind it. For the selfishness, the pride, the unbelief that said, “my way is better.” Wash me clean. Cover me in the blood of Jesus. Silence the voice of the accuser who says I’m dirty, unworthy, or disqualified. That’s not Your voice. Your voice says “redeemed,” “forgiven,”, “Mine," and "dearly loved by Me.”</p>

<p>Help me understand that repentance isn’t just regret — it’s redirection. I don’t want to just feel bad about this… I want to change. Strengthen my resolve. Show me what led to this moment — what wound, what habit, what lie opened the door. Help me to face it and give it to You for healing. And give me the courage to deal with it honestly. Let this fall become a turning point, a learning lesson, not a trap.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a moment of relief, but a life of freedom. I want to passionately desire a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — the kind that runs to You in failure instead of hiding from You. Bring the right people, scriptures, counsel, tools, and truth to help me rebuild. Thank You for loving me in the mess. I’m getting back up — because You’re still with me.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
