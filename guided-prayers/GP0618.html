<h2>A Prayer for Someone Who Needs Salvation</h2>

<p>Father, I bring before You someone I care about — someone who doesn’t know You yet. You created them. You love them. You’ve been pursuing them since before they were born. But right now, they’re still far from You. Maybe they don’t believe. Maybe they’ve been hurt by the church. Maybe they’ve just never seen the real You — the Jesus who saves, who heals, who transforms, who loves without limits. The Jesus who is always loving, caring and kind. Whatever the reason, they’re still lost. And my heart is heavy for them.</p>

<p>Lord, open their eyes. Soften their heart. Break through the walls they’ve built — the pride, the pain, the questions, the excuses, the lies. Silence the voice of the enemy that tells them You’re not real, You’re not good, or You’re not worth following. Expose every deception that keeps them from truth. Remove the blinders. Let light flood in. And let it be undeniable that it’s You calling to them.</p>

<p>Father, bring the right people into their life — voices of grace and truth. Send someone who reflects Your love so purely that they can’t help but notice. Use conversations, memories, dreams, books, songs — anything You want — to awaken something eternal in them. And if You want to use me, I’m available. Help me love them well. Not to preach at them or pressure them, but to live in a way that reflects You honestly and faithfully. A way that will encourage them to want the God I love.</p>

<p>Give me patience, God. Help me keep praying even when I don’t see results. Help me trust Your timing. And please, protect their life until the day they finally surrender to You. Don’t let the enemy win. Don’t let this world have them. Rescue them. Redeem them. Bring them home to You.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just belief, but salvation. Not just words, but transformation. A stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — the kind that changes everything. Don’t let them settle for less. You died to save them — let that not be in vain for them. Chase them down. Surround them with Your mercy. And bring them into the joy of being fully known and fully loved by You.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
