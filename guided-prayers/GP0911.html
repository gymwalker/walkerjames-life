<h2>A Prayer for Victory Over Temptation</h2>

<p>Most Gracious Heavenly Father, I come to You in the name of Jesus — not as someone perfect, but as someone fully dependent on You and Your power to overcome. You know every weakness I face. You know every temptation that waits for me — the obvious ones and the subtle ones. The ones I’ve seen before and the ones I’ve fallen to in the past. Sometimes, over and over again. But You are faithful. And You’ve promised that with every temptation, You will provide a way of escape. So I’m asking — lead me to that escape plan before I fall.</p>

<p>Lord, I don’t just want to resist temptation — I want to walk in victory over it. I don’t want to flirt with sin. I don’t want to toy with compromise. I don’t want to live on the edge of obedience. I don't want to feed my flesh, because when I do, it only gets stronger, more powerful, harder to resist. I want to run hard after You. Give me eyes to see temptation coming before it arrives. Give me discernment when the enemy tries to wrap sin in something attractive, familiar, or even religious. Give me the strength to walk away, the courage to say no, and the clarity to see what’s really at stake. Encourage me at every turn to feed Your Spirit that lives within me, so that, He will grow in power, in strength, and authority over my temptations.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, I reject the lie that I’m too weak.  
I reject the lie that I have no choice.  
I reject the lie that this time won’t hurt.  
I reject the lie that I can’t break free.  
I reject the lie that God won’t forgive me if I fail.  
And I reject the voice that says temptation defines me. **You, are the only one that defines me, Lord.**</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, be louder than my flesh. Be stronger than my cravings. Be nearer than the voices calling me away. Let the fear of the Lord anchor me. Let the love of Jesus draw me. Let the Word of God steady me. And let Your presence remind me that I am never alone in the fight. This isn’t just about saying no to sin — it’s about saying yes to something better. I want Your peace, not the shame. I want Your joy, not the guilt. I want Your presence, not a moment of escape. Help me to feed upon Your truth, feeding You, and empowering You in the process.</p>

<p>So right now, I declare: I am not a slave to sin. I am not ruled by urges. I am not owned by the enemy. I am a child of the Living God, bought with a price, filled with the Spirit, and called to holiness. Temptation may come — but I will not bow. I will not compromise. I will not trade intimacy with You for temporary satisfaction. I belong to You. I will not choose anything that interferes with my relationship with You Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a pure heart, a clean mind, a surrendered will, and a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Make me alert. Make me ready. Make me holy — not just in the moment of testing, but in the habits that prepare me for it.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, I choose victory — not later, but now.  
I choose obedience — not out of fear, but out of love.  
And I choose You — not just once, but again and again and again.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>
