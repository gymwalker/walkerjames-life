<h2>A Prayer for a Fresh Start</h2>

<p>Father, I’m ready. I don’t have all the answers. I still feel a little nervous, a little unsure, maybe even unqualified. But I know this: I can’t stay where I’ve been. I’ve lived in the shadows of shame, regret, sin, fear, and failure long enough. I’ve let the past speak louder than Your promises. And I’ve let excuses and failure convince me I couldn’t start again. But today, I’m choosing something different. I’m choosing to believe that with You, fresh starts are possible.</p>

<p>Thank You for Your mercy that is new every morning. Thank You for not giving up on me. Thank You for grace that reaches deeper than any pit I’ve fallen into. I know I can’t change the past, but with You, the future is not only possible — it can be redeemed, restored, and made beautiful once again.</p>

<p>So here I am, Lord. I surrender the old — the habits, the hangups, the lies, the bitterness, the pride, the guilt, and the broken pieces. I leave them at the cross. I receive Your forgiveness, Your cleansing, and Your invitation to begin again — not by my strength, but by Yours. Let this be a turning point in my life. Let this be the day things shift and change for the good. Not just because I say so, but because You’re in it with me.</p>

<p>Guide me in this new beginning. Show me how to walk in step with You. Help me stay grounded in truth and rooted in grace. Place people in my life who will support this new direction, who will speak truth with love, who will remind me of who I am and whose I am. Help me invest in the things that matter — in time with You, in service to others, in healing, and in growth. And when I’m tempted to go back, remind me why I started forward in the first place.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a new chapter, but a new heart. Not just a reset, but a resurrection. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that defines every part of this fresh start. I don’t need easy. I just need You. And I’m not walking alone. Thank you for the gift of Your love and grace.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
