<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Spiritually Distant</h2>

<p>Father, I feel far from You — not because You moved, but because somewhere along the way… I did. It didn’t happen overnight. It was subtle at first — a missed prayer here, a distracted thought there, a season of busyness, a quiet disappointment. But now I find myself wondering how I got here, feeling disconnected from the One I love most. And even though I don’t always feel it… I miss You. I miss our closeness. I miss being near to Your heart.</p>

<p>I know You haven’t turned away. I know You haven’t given up on me. You never do. You never will. But right now, I need to come home — not just with words, but with my whole heart. All of me, my very soul. I need You to pull me out of this spiritual fog. Out of the numbness. Out of the routine. I need a spark again. I need Your passion, Your desire, for Your World distracted by sin and deception. A holy fire. A renewed hunger. A deeper longing for Your presence, Your truth, and Your voice.</p>

<p>Forgive me, Lord — for the distractions I chose, the idols I entertained, the bitterness I let linger, and the sin I excused. Forgive me for letting distance grow when I could have run to You sooner. Cleanse my heart. Clear the clutter. Pull me back into the warmth of Your embrace. I don’t want shallow religion. I want restored relationship. I want real connection again — real intimacy with the God who loves me. The God who adores me. The God who desires me.</p>

<p>Jesus, meet me here. Even if I don’t know what to say. Even if I don’t feel much right now. Even if I’m unsure how to begin again. I bring You my desire — however faint — and ask You to fan it into flame. Stir up the faith in me that’s been buried under disappointment, shame, or fear. Help me stop measuring my worth by how I perform, and instead remember who I am: a child of the Living God, already accepted, already loved, already welcome in Your presence.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just spiritual activity, but spiritual intimacy. Not just a checklist of faith, but a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. One where Your presence is my priority, where Your voice is the loudest, and where Your love is the foundation I stand on — no matter what. I’m coming back, Lord. Reignite what’s grown cold. Restore what’s grown distant. I’m Yours… again.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
