<h2>A Prayer of Gratitude for When You’ve Been Set Free</h2>

<p>God, thank You for the freedom You’ve given me. I don’t deserve it. I couldn’t earn it. I didn’t break my own chains — You did. You stepped into my darkness, reached into my prison, and pulled me out with Your mercy and power and love. And now I stand on the other side of that bondage, with breath in my lungs and hope in my heart, all because of You.</p>

<p>I remember the weight I used to carry — the guilt, the shame, the fear, the addiction, the anger, the lies. I remember how hopeless it felt, how impossible it seemed. But You weren’t intimidated by my chains. You weren’t afraid of my sin. You met me right there — in the mess, in the pain, in the middle of what I thought would never change — and You brought freedom. Real, lasting, Spirit-led freedom. And not just freedom, but transformation. And for all of that, I am truly grateful.</p>

<p>Thank You, Jesus, for the cross. For paying what I could never pay. For walking into death and rising again with victory in Your hands — my victory. Thank You for not just setting me free from something, but calling me into something new. A new identity. A new story. A new life as a Child of the Living God. Thank You for giving me a reason to worship, a reason to live, a reason to dance in the middle of what used to be a battlefield.</p>

<p>Help me never forget what You’ve done. Help me to live with the kind of gratitude that shows up in how I speak, how I love, how I forgive, how I serve, how I live my life. Let my life be a thank-you note to You. Let my story become a testimony to others still in chains. Remind me that freedom isn’t just for me — it’s meant to overflow to everyone around me.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a clean record, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where freedom fuels my worship. One where I never go back to what You rescued me from. One where I walk boldly in the light, hand in hand with the One who set me free.</p>

<p>Thank You for breaking my chains. Thank You for loving me enough to fight for me. Thank You for being the God who frees the captives — and who never stops calling them closer.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
