<h2>A Prayer for a New Season</h2>

<p>Father, something’s changing. I can feel it. Maybe it’s subtle — a quiet shifting of the ground beneath my feet. Or maybe it’s obvious — doors closing, new ones opening, and life moving in a different direction than I expected. Either way, I know You are in it and I trust You in it. I know seasons don’t shift without Your permission. So instead of resisting, I’m choosing to lean in — even if I don’t have all the answers, I trust You.</p>

<p>Thank You for what You’ve done in the last season — even the hard parts. Thank You for the lessons learned, the strength built, the grace sustained. And thank You that You’re not done with me. What You’ve started, You will finish. I’m not the same person I was, and I don’t want to be. I’m growing. I’m healing. I’m changing — and You are leading every step of the way.</p>

<p>As I step into this new season, I lay down every fear. I release the urge to control. I surrender the need to have it all figured out. I trust You — not just with the destination, but with the process. Help me walk with expectancy, not anxiety. With faith, not fear. With joy, not hesitation. You go before me, and that’s all I need to know.</p>

<p>Prepare my heart for what’s ahead. Prune what no longer belongs. Plant new seeds where old things have died. Bring clarity where there’s been confusion. Give me wisdom for each decision and peace in the waiting. Let this season be one of growth, intimacy, fruitfulness, and transformation. And help me not just survive it — help me embrace it, celebrate it, and thrive in it, because You are in it.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a season of blessing, but a season of becoming. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that sustains me in every season. You are my constant. You are my guide. You are the One who makes all things new. And I trust You to write this next chapter, one step at a time.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
