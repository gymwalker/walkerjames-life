<h2>A Prayer of Praise in the Waiting</h2>

<p>God, I’m still waiting. Still praying. Still hoping. And while part of me grows weary in the silence, another part of me wants to choose praise — even here, even now. Not because everything has changed, but because You haven’t. You are still worthy. You are still good. You are still God, even in the waiting.</p>

<p>I praise You not just for the things You’ve already done, but for who You are while I wait. You are faithful, even when I’m frustrated. You are present, even when I feel alone. You are working behind the scenes, even when I can’t see the progress. I don’t want to let delay steal my worship or my joy. I don’t want to let disappointment steal my praise. I want to be found loving You in the in-between — not just at the finish line.</p>

<p>Teach me how to praise without conditions. To worship without waiting for the breakthrough. Let my trust rise higher than my questions. Let my praise be a weapon against doubt and discouragement. You are not on pause — You are active, moving, shaping, refining. So I will lift my voice, not because I’ve arrived, but because I know You’re still leading me forward.</p>

<p>Help me to anchor my heart in truth. Remind me of what You’ve already done. Show me how to be grateful for today while believing for tomorrow. Lead me to Scriptures that speak to my soul, songs that lift my spirit, and people who stir my faith. Let this waiting season become a worship season — one that builds something beautiful in me.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just an answer to my prayer, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where praise isn’t postponed until after the blessing, but offered freely in every season. One where I don’t just wait on You — I wait with You.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient, for being faithful, for being with me. I trust You. I praise You. I’m still here… and I know You are too.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
