<h2>A Prayer of Deliverance from Evil</h2>

<p>Father God, Most High — Deliverer, Defender, and Lord of Hosts — I come before You in the name above every name: Jesus Christ. I stand under the covering of His blood and the authority of His cross, and the authority of a Child of the Living God. I call upon You now for complete deliverance from every evil influence that has tried to attach itself to my life. I don't want partial freedom — I want full and total rescue. No darkness left. No chains unbroken. No demons hiding. Let every presence, influence, agreement, and residue of evil be cast out now — in Jesus’ name.</p>

<p>I renounce all ties to darkness — every open door, every unholy alliance, every invitation I gave knowingly or unknowingly. I reject all influence from witchcraft, occult practices, generational sin, perversion, addiction, pornography, trauma, abuse, word curses, soul ties, rebellion, and idolatry. I come out of agreement with every stronghold the enemy has tried to use to harass me, control me, confuse me, distract me, sideline me, or isolate me. I break every chain now — by the power of Jesus Christ, the authority of His Word, and the fire of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Every spirit that does not bow to Jesus — leave now. You are not welcome. You are not permitted. You are trespassing on God’s property. I command all devel, demon or demonic forces or spirits to go where Jesus sends you. You have no more claim, no more voice, and no more access, no legal right. I silence your lies. I strip your power. I cancel every assignment you’ve been working to fulfill. The only voice I will follow is the voice of my Shepherd, Jesus Christ — and He has already declared me free.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, come and fill every place that has been vacated. Where confusion was — speak truth. Where torment was — bring peace. Where shame lived — pour grace. Where fear ruled — release boldness. Where death hovered — breathe resurrection life. Let the weight of Your presence be heavy. Let Your holiness fill the atmosphere. Let the name of Jesus be exalted so high that no enemy can breathe near me without trembling.</p>

<p>I don’t want surface-level healing. I want a complete deliverance. Burn away every root of darkness, even the ones I’ve grown used to. Shine light on every blind spot. Uproot every agreement I didn’t even know I made. Sweep my soul clean — not just for peace, but for purpose. Not just for comfort, but for calling. I was not born to be tormented — I was born to carry Your glory. To shine Your light and Your love into this world.</p>

<p>I want what You want — complete freedom, full surrender, and a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Deliver me not just from the evil around me, but from anything evil that still lingers within. And once delivered, teach me how to live like I’ve been set free.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ mighty and delivering name — the name that casts out devils and conquers death — I pray, declare, and believe it is done.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
