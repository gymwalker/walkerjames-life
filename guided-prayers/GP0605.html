<h2>A Prayer for My Children</h2>

<p>Father, thank You for the precious gift of my children. Thank You for entrusting them to me — to guide, protect, love, and raise in Your truth. They are not mine alone; they are Yours first. You formed them, You know them, and You have a purpose for each of them that’s far greater than anything I could imagine. Help me never take that responsibility lightly.</p>

<p>I pray over their hearts — that You would make them soft to Your voice and strong against the lies of the world. Teach them what is true, what is good, and what is eternal. Protect them from every scheme of the enemy and every counterfeit promise that would lead them astray. Let their identities be anchored in who You say they are, not what others say or what the culture shouts at them. Or the lies that the world so often screams at them.</p>

<p>Give them courage to stand for what is right, humility to admit when they’re wrong, and wisdom to walk in Your ways. Fill them with compassion for the hurting, and integrity in the hidden places. Let them be lights in a dark world — not perfect, but real. Not religious, but deeply rooted in relationship with You.</p>

<p>And Father, help me lead by example. Let my life, my words, my actions, my reactions, and my priorities teach them how to follow You. Where I’ve failed or fallen short, forgive me — and help me make it right. Fill our home with laughter, grace, truth, and the kind of love that makes it easier to believe in You. Surround them with mentors, friends, teachers, and leaders who will point them toward the cross and toward their calling.</p>

<p>And Father, help me steward time well. Life moves so fast, and I know I won’t always have the same access to their hearts. Help me make the most of these days — not just being around them, but being truly present with them. Don’t let busyness steal what matters most. Help me to invest time into nourishing their faith, encouraging their questions, and pointing them to You in everything. Let the way I spend time with them reveal how deeply I’ve fallen in love with You — so that they will want to know You, too.</p>

<p>Help me never take their presence for granted. They are not interruptions or obligations — they are miracles, entrusted into my care. As they grow older, help me to shift from giving orders to offering wisdom, from correcting to championing, from controlling to covering them in prayer. Show me how to support what You are calling them to do, not just what I think they should do. And give me discernment to protect them from the distractions of this world — social media, peer pressure, empty affirmation, and anything that makes them question their worth. Help me to give them confidence in who they are as children of the living God — chosen, called, and loved.</p>

<p>Give me wisdom, Father, to guide them in choosing their friends wisely. Help me see what they don’t yet see — the subtle influences, the hidden risks, and the voices that may speak louder than truth. And give them the discernment to recognize the kind of friendships that honor You. Let their closest friends be people who stir up faith, not compromise it — who encourage them to fall more in love with You, not drift away from You. Protect them from relationships that pull them into darkness, and bless them with friendships that anchor them in Your light. Help me to give the tools that encourage them from picking up stupid and hurting themselves with it!</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just well-behaved kids, but children who walk in a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. I want them to know You — not just know about You. I want them to love You with all their hearts and follow You all their days. Bring the right influences, the right words, the right convictions, the right truths, and the right encounters to shape their journey. And help me trust You more than I fear the world — because You are their Father too.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
