  <h3>🟩 Tuesday – Surrender and Trust</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, today I release control. I surrender my plans, expectations, and outcomes into Your hands — because You know what’s best.</li>
    <li>► Help me loosen my grip on what I can’t control. You are God — not me. Let that truth set me free.</li>
    <li>► Lord, teach me how to trust You — not just with words, but with actions, attitudes, and decisions, and the way I respond to the challenges in this day.</li>
    <li>► If I’m clinging to something You’re asking me to let go of, give me the strength to obey, even when it’s painful.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that surrender isn’t failure — it’s freedom. It’s choosing Your will over my way.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, if I’m holding on to anxiety, fear, resentment, or regret, help me place it at Your feet and leave it there.</li>
    <li>► Show me the places where I’m still trying to prove myself instead of resting in who You say I am.</li>
    <li>► God, You are not a backup plan. You are THE plan. Help me stop trying to manipulate outcomes and start yielding to Your Spirit.</li>
    <li>► Help me live with open hands — not clenching, not grasping — but ready to receive, ready to let go, and ready to serve.</li>
    <li>► Father, help me trust Your timing. Even when You seem silent or slow, I choose to believe You are at work behind the scenes.</li>
    <li>► Give me the courage to take the next step — even if it’s uncertain — because I know You’re walking with me.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that surrender doesn’t mean passivity. It means faith-filled action in step with You.</li>
    <li>► Lord, where I’m tempted to worry, interrupt me with Your peace. Let me rest in Your sovereignty — not spiral in speculation.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve made an idol out of something, encourage me to let go of it. Teach me to walk by faith, to fully trust in You, to fully surrender to You. I don’t need to know everything — I just need to know You’re near.</li>
    <li>► Holy Spirit, highlight any area where I’ve been resisting You. I don’t want anything in me to be off-limits to Your Lordship. Rule and reign over every aspect of my life.</li>
    <li>► Lord, take my insecurities and transform them into trust. I don’t need to be perfect — I just need to trust You in and with everything.</li>
    <li>► If I'm disappointed with how something turned out, remind me that surrender means trusting You even when it hurts. Even when I don't like the results.</li>
    <li>► Let my “yes” to You today be full — not half-hearted. Not reluctant. Not reserved. All in. All Yours.</li>
    <li>► Break any illusion that I’m in control — gently, lovingly, and clearly — so I stop striving and start abiding.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, help me to trust not just in Your power, but in Your heart. I know who You are. You are good, can only do good, can be nothing but good, will do nothing but good.</li>
    <li>► Father, if I’m discouraged, help me not to give up. I surrender the outcome, but I will not surrender my trust and faith in You.</li>
    <li>► Give me grace to embrace today — not the day I wish I had, but the one You’ve given me — with trust and gratitude.</li>
    <li>► Help me breathe deeply, walk slowly, and live intentionally — grounded in You, not driven by pressure.</li>
    <li>► I trust You, God — not just with today, but with everything. My future. My hopes. My dreams. My story. My soul. It's all Yours.</li>
