  <h3>Tuesday...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Lord, open my eyes to the hurts, needs, and struggles of a world that so desperately needs You and Your love. Use me as Your instrument to inject Your love into hurting and rebellious lives. Help me to always see things from YOUR perspective.</li>
    <li>► I give You permission to rule and reign over my mind, my thoughts, my flesh, my heart. I give You the authority to rule and reign over all of who I am. Cast out anything in me that is not of You, Lord Jesus.</li>
    <li>► Lord, there are temptations to sin everywhere. Help me not to give in. Make me sensitive to the escape routes You provide. I want my love for You—and for others—to be real, and to encourage deeper faith and relationship with You.</li>
    <li>► Make this a three-way conversation. Help me to know Your thoughts and respond to You…to wait on You and listen to You and for You.</li>
    <li>► Allow me to live by Your Spirit and be controlled by Your Spirit...denying my flesh and being ruled by You and Your Spirit.</li>
    <li>► Lord Jesus, I want to live for You. Let Your life and love flow through me today, so that others will see You living in me and be drawn to You, the Living Water.</li>
    <li>► Father, I choose this day to serve You. What can I do for You today? Help me to know what You desire and empower me to do it.</li>
    <li>► Father, consume me with Your love. Fill me to overflowing with Your love. Let it pour back to You and out to others.</li>
    <li>► Because of what Your Son Jesus did for me on the Cross, I present my body, my life, my mind, my soul, my heart, my strength—a living sacrifice—holy and acceptable in Your sight and for Your service.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, my Lord and King, I surrender to You and Your will for my life. Everything I have is Yours to do with and use as You please. Everything I am is Yours. Help me to surrender fully and serve You and others with joy.</li>
    <li>► Father, help me to accomplish every task You set before me today and every day.</li>
    <li>► Draw me into a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You today—no matter what it takes.</li>
    <li>► Help me be content where You have me and wait patiently for what more You want to give.</li>
    <li>► Help me make and keep a covenant with my eyes, heart, mind, and thoughts—to never lust after anyone who is not my spouse.</li>
    <li>► Let my life be a witness for You. May everyone I encounter see You shining through me—and turn to Christ because of it.</li>
    <li>► Father, build in me the character You desire. Let my character perfectly reflect You.</li>
    <li>► Help me resist the temptations and lusts of fame, fortune, power, pleasure, pride, and arrogance.</li>
    <li>► Help me to be like Christ.</li>
    <li>► Help me enjoy this time with You and to desire more time with You every day.</li>
    <li>► Let me live and embrace You—confidently knowing You know me, love me, and long for a relationship with me. Strengthen my relationship with You and with others.</li>
    <li>► Help me meet with You daily—to linger in Your presence, to shut out the noise, and to praise, worship, love, and appreciate You in the quietness of my heart.</li>
    <li>► Give me eyes to see through my circumstances and ears to hear Your voice. Reassure me and help me fully trust You in ALL things—because You are good, only do good, and can do nothing but good.</li>
    <li>► Help me let go of anything getting in the way of the best relationship with You—and the best relationships with others.</li>
    <li>► Father, take my heart and make it completely Yours. Possess me. Unite me with You.</li>
    <li>► Give me confidence in who I am, in Your love for me, in what You’ve created me to do, and how You want me to serve You. Help me be a faithful servant of Your Kingdom.</li>
    <li>► Lord, use this day to deepen my knowledge of You. Take first place in my heart. Reveal Yourself more clearly. Help me represent You perfectly to others, and keep sin out of my life and relationships.</li>
    <li>► Today, help me be still and know that You are God.</li>
    <li>► Make me a sincere, true worshiper of You.</li>
    <li>► Help me walk in integrity—truthful, honest, and free from sin and corruption—in every area of my life.</li>
    <li>► Help me do the things You desire today. Help me be the person You’ve called me to be—for You, for others, and for those I love.</li>
    <li>► Make me hunger and thirst for a character like Yours. Help me passionately desire and develop it by choosing actions that reflect Your nature.</li>
    <li>► Help me to fear only You. Make me courageous in You. Help me fully and completely trust in You.</li>
    <li>► Father, give me vision—dreams You want to fulfill through me or in me.</li>
    <li>► Guide me safely through the enemy’s maze—through lies, traps, mirages, and temptations. Keep my focus locked on You, walking close beside You, in Your presence all day and night.</li>
    <li>► Father, thank You for knowing everything about me and still loving me. Thank You for caring for me, for choosing me, for bringing me to this moment. Thank You for making me Your favorite—not condemning me, but pouring out judgment on Jesus instead of me. I praise You for Your mercy!</li>
