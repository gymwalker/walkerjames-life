  <h3>ðŸŸ¨ Tuesday â€“ Kingdom Alignment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, I want what You want. Not just in theory â€” but in every part of my life. Let Your Kingdom come, and let it start with me.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, Iâ€™ve got plans, but I lay them down. If theyâ€™re not from You, I donâ€™t want them. Replace my small dreams with Your greater purpose.</li>
    <li>â–º Show me what matters most in Your Kingdom today â€” and help me pursue it with courage, boldness, and love.</li>
    <li>â–º Let my work today be about more than getting things done. Use it to advance Your Kingdom â€” even in quiet, unseen ways.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, teach me to pray with Kingdom vision. Not just for what makes life easier â€” but for what makes souls whole.</li>
    <li>â–º Jesus, You are the King. I donâ€™t want to live like Iâ€™m in charge anymore. Reign in my thoughts, my words, and my choices.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me choose what honors You â€” even if it costs me something. Let Your will be done, not mine.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me eyes to see how Youâ€™re working in the world around me â€” and the boldness to join You in it.</li>
    <li>â–º Use my gifts and time and energy for Your glory. I donâ€™t want to build my own empire. I want to build Your Kingdom.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, give me discernment to know when to act and when to wait â€” when to speak up and when to listen.</li>
    <li>â–º Break my heart for what breaks Yours. Let me carry not just my burdens, but also the weight of compassion for others.</li>
    <li>â–º Jesus, donâ€™t let me be numb to the lost and the hurting. Let my prayers move me to action â€” because love always moves.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, align my calendar with Your calling. Interrupt my plans with divine appointments. I give You permission to rearrange my day.</li>
    <li>â–º If there are strongholds in my life that resist Your will, tear them down. I want nothing in me to stand in the way of what You want to do.</li>
    <li>â–º Let my home reflect Heaven today â€” filled with grace, truth, peace, and love. Make me an ambassador of Your presence.</li>
    <li>â–º I surrender my influence â€” online and in person. Let my words reflect Your heart. Let my presence point people to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Remind me that Your Kingdom often grows in hidden places â€” in faithfulness, humility, and obedience. Help me be okay with that.</li>
    <li>â–º I trust that even when I canâ€™t see the impact, You are still moving. Let my faith rest in Your power â€” not in my performance.</li>
    <li>â–º Today, I choose obedience over comfort. I choose surrender over control. I choose You over everything else.</li>
    <li>â–º Come, Lord Jesus. Not just to the world someday â€” but to the center of my life today. Be King here.</li>
