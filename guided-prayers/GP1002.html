<h3>ðŸŸ© Tuesday â€“ Pursue His Kingdom First</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Abba Father, I accept Your invitation into perfect union â€” Father, Son, and Spirit. Let my life reflect the love and oneness You share with each other. I want nothing less than to dwell in the center of that holy intimacy every moment.</li>
  <li>Father God, unite with me today. Surround me, fill me, and flow through me. Let my thoughts, my choices, and my worship be a living reflection of Your Spirit, Your love, and Your truth alive in me.</li>
  <li>Holy Spirit, consume every part of me. Take all of me. Possess all of me. Empower me to live a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christâ€”completely led by You.</li>
  <li>Father, Help me invest deeply in my relationship with You. Let seeking, knowing, and walking with You be my highest priority and greatest pursuit every day.</li>
  <li>Holy Spirit, overflow me with Your love, Your presence, and Your heart for others. Let my life be marked by Your influenceâ€”guiding my words and shaping my actions to reflect Jesus.</li>
  <li>Father, lead me away from fear, distraction, and lesser desires. Fix my focus on You and Your Kingdom â€” not the temporary, but the eternal. Guide me by Your Spirit, with clarity and peace, into all that You have for me today.</li>
  <li>Father, fill me with wisdom, insight, discernment, discipline, and Your shalom peace in everything I do for You and with You. Let my actions be shaped by Your Spirit, not my flesh.</li>
  <li>Father, awaken every spiritual sense within me. Open my eyes to eternal things. Give me supernatural perception so I may see, know, and respond to what truly matters to You.</li>
  <li>Father, let me taste, see, and know that You are good. Make Your presence and Your Kingdom more real to me than anything this world could ever offer.</li>
  <li>Father, Iâ€™m overwhelmed by Your mercy, Your grace. My only worthy response is praise and worship of who You are. Thank You for choosing me, adopting me, redeeming me, and revealing the beauty of Your gospel, to me.</li>
  <li>Thank You, Jesus, for giving me Your power, Your strength, and Your authority to affect this world for Your Kingdom and Your Glory. Let me live today fully aligned with You, walking in Your presence and depending on Your Spirit.</li>
  <li>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit â€” I long for Your return, for the day You rule and reign over all. May Your Kingdom come quickly. Let my heart be found ready, watching, and full of faith, joy, and excitement.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Father, help me live with an others-focused heart â€” to love and serve the way You would have me love and serve. Teach me to care about what You care about, to value what You value, and to love simply because You loveâ€¦ and You are love.</li>
    <li>Father, thank You for knowing everything about me â€” and still choosing to love me. Thank You for caring, for pursuing me, for calling me Yours. Thank You for adoring me, for calling me Your favorite, and for not condemning meâ€¦ but instead judging and punishing Jesus in my place. I am overwhelmed by Your mercy and grace.</li>
    <li>Father, thank You for rebuilding, repairing, and restoring me. I belong to You â€” fully, freely, and forever. No conditions. No exceptions. No holding back. No matter what, I will love You. No matter what, I will trust You.</li>
    <li>Father, give me the vision and dreams that come from You â€” whether You want me to fulfill them for You, or You intend to fulfill them for me. Let my heart be fully aligned with Yours in every desire and direction.</li>
    <li>Father, help me walk in honesty in every part of my life. Make me a person of integrity â€” faithful, truthful, and upright. Let me be a person who reflects Your righteousness, free from sin, deception, and compromise.</li>
    <li>Father, shape my heart to dream the dreams Youâ€™ve placed within me. Align my desires with Yours, and help me bear lasting fruit â€” for Your glory and for the sake of Your Kingdom.</li>
    <li>Father, help me to truly know You â€” to grow daily in deep, intimate relationship with You. Open my eyes to the beauty and wonder of who You are, that I may perceive You more clearly and love You more fully.</li>
    <li>Father, help me to be generous with everything Youâ€™ve entrusted to me. My time is Yours. My money is Yours. My energy, my resources, my gifts â€” they all belong to You. Teach me to give without hesitation, to hold nothing back, and to follow Your leading with complete surrender, and obedience.</li>
    <li>Father, ignite in me a relentless hunger and thirst for Your character â€” to crave who You are, to pursue who You are, and to reflect You in who I am. Make me a perfect reflection of Your Son Jesus.</li>
    <li>Father, help me to know, believe, and boldly share the truth about who You are and how deeply You love us. Teach me, anchor it in me, and use me to share it with others.</li>
    <li>Father, draw me into a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You â€” today and alwaysâ€¦ no matter what it takes.</li>
    <li>Father, help me grow and become part of a great team. Shape me into a leader who loves You and reflects Your love to those Youâ€™ve entrusted to me. Let them see You, Your love, and Your light in me â€” and respond to You because of it. Help me serve them with humility and strength, just as You would have me.</li>
    <li>Father, help me reject the pull of my flesh and choose the leading of Your Spirit in everything I do. Let Your Spirit guide my thoughts, my choices, and my desires â€” so that my life brings You glory and honor, not compromise.</li>
    <li>Father, help me reflect You so clearly that anyone who crosses my path sees Christ alive in me. Let Your light shine through every word, every action, and every moment â€” drawing others to You because of what they witness in me.</li>
    <li>Father, donâ€™t let me sit on the sidelines. Make me an active, faithful, and invested part of Your Church â€” fully engaged in building Your Kingdom today and every day.</li>
    <li>Father, I know You are the Potter and I am the clay. Shape me into a vessel fit for Your useâ€”one that glorifies You and advances Your Kingdom. Let Your light and love shine through me into this dark and desperate world.</li>
    <li>Father, make me hungry for Youâ€”for all of Youâ€”for more of You! Let nothing else satisfy the ache in my soul but You and Your presence.</li>
    <li>Father, renew and transform my mindâ€”strip away every lie, distortion, and distractionâ€”until I think like You, reason like You, and see everything through Your truth.</li>
    <li>Father, use Your Spirit who lives in me to guide my decisionsâ€”help me clearly discern right from wrong, good from evil, and choose what pleases You. Help me always choose good, do good, be generous, loving, caring, and kindâ€”so that I can be You with skin on.</li>
    <li>Father, You know my heartâ€”I love You, I adore You, and I long for Your Kingdom to come and flourish. Show me where You want me to step in and how You want me to serve. Give me the wisdom to take part exactly where You need me.</li>
    <li>Father, help me to actively rely on Your Spiritâ€”to renew my strength, sharpen my discernment, and equip me fully for every assignment Youâ€™ve entrusted to me today and every day. Let nothing distract me from the work Youâ€™ve called me to do.</li>
    <li>Father, help me be content with where You have me, even as I wait with expectation for the more I long for from You. Teach me to rest in Your timing and trust that every season has a purpose.</li>
    <li>Father, help me do nothing out of selfish ambition or pride. Give me a heart of true humility that sees others as more valuable than myself. Teach me to look beyond my own interestsâ€”to genuinely care for the needs, burdens, and well-being of those around me.</li>
    <li>Father, teach me to fear nothing but You. Make me bold in Youâ€”anchored, unshaken, and brave. Fill me with unwavering trust in who You are, what Youâ€™ve said, and what Youâ€™re doingâ€¦ even when I canâ€™t see it.</li>
    <li>Father, help me finish well. Help me finish strong. Keep my eyes locked on the prizeâ€”on You aloneâ€”so I donâ€™t drift, donâ€™t slow down, and donâ€™t give up. You are my goal, my reward, and my reason.</li>
    <li>Father, help me place all my trust and faith in Youâ€”fully and without reservation. Teach me to follow You boldly, to obey You completely, to honor and glorify You in everything I do. Let me rely on You for all thingsâ€¦ be willing to die for You if thatâ€™s what it takesâ€¦ and live like You are more than enough. Help me truly seek first Your Kingdomâ€”above all else, no matter the cost.</li>
    <li>Father, help me store up treasure in Heavenâ€”not here on earth. Let everything I do, say, and think advance Your Kingdom and declare that You alone are my treasure, my portion, and my reward.</li>
    <li>Father, I give all of myself to all of You! Take every part of meâ€”my heart, my mind, my hands, my voice. Use me completely and without hesitation for Your glory and purpose!</li>

  <li>Father, I declare that sin is not my master. You alone are Lord over my life, and I refuse to let sin have any rule, reign, or influence over me today.</li>
  <li>I surrender every part of my body to Youâ€”my mind, my mouth, my hands, my feet, my thoughts, and my desires. Let everything in me be devoted to Your glory.</li>
  <li>I know I cannot do this on my own. But You can. So I invite Youâ€”live in me, and live through me. Let Your righteousness be my strength and Your Spirit my guide.</li>
  <li>My Lord and my God and my King Jesus, I put my trust in You to fight my battles. There is nothing in this world that can separate me from Your love. Grow and strengthen my trust in You.</li>
  <li>Since I know that Your power and authority has been given to me by the cross of Jesus Christ, show Your power and authority in and through me. Provide for my needs, protect me, and fill me with Your strength, love, and wisdom.</li>
  <li>Father, help me resist the lure and temptation of prideâ€”thinking of myself as more important than I am. Help me never steal or desire Your glory or what belongs to You. Teach me to always give You full credit and never misrepresent You.</li>
  <li>Father, protect me from lust and the desires of my flesh. Help me not to give in to selfish, self-centered passions. Let my life honor and glorify You. May everything I do bring glory to Your name.</li>
  <li>Father, give me a strong, powerful, steady confidence in Youâ€”like Elisha had. Help me trust You in all things, to see this life as temporary, to live for the eternal, and to focus fully on serving and glorifying You.</li>
  <li>Father God, Youâ€™ve shown me what matters mostâ€”seeking You and Your Kingdom first, loving You with all that I am, and loving others the way You love me.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to live my purpose todayâ€”to love and glorify You, to love others, to be like Jesus, to serve You and Your kingdom, and to tell others about Your fierce love for them, to be holy as You are holy, to be filled with the Holy Spirit at all times, and to be grateful for everything You are doing and have done in my life.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Heavenly Father, I put on Your full armor:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The belt of truth</strong> â€” to hold everything together and guard me from deception; to remind me that truth is found in You alone.</li>
      <li><strong>The breastplate of righteousness</strong> â€” to protect my heart and keep it aligned with Your purity and holiness, not my own efforts.</li>
      <li><strong>The gospel of peace</strong> â€” as shoes for my feet, grounding me in the message of hope, reconciliation, and readiness to walk wherever You send me.</li>
      <li><strong>The shield of faith</strong> â€” to extinguish every fiery dart of fear, doubt, accusation, and temptation hurled at me by the enemy.</li>
      <li><strong>The helmet of salvation</strong> â€” to guard my mind, my thoughts, and my identity in Christ, reminding me I belong to You and that my eternity is secure.</li>
      <li><strong>The sword of the Spirit â€” Your Word</strong> â€” to cut through lies, defeat the enemyâ€™s schemes, and strike back with truth, power, precision, and divine authority.</li>
      <li><strong>The power of prayer</strong> â€” to stay in constant communion with You, to align my will with Yours, and to call Heaven down into my situation, and to come to the assistance of others as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>The power of praise and worship</strong> â€” to shift the atmosphere, silence the enemy, and magnify You above everything else.</li>
      <li><strong>The power of the blood of Jesus</strong> â€” my ultimate covering, my victory, and my authority. Nothing can stand against the blood of my Savior â€” Jesus Christ.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make me an instrument of Your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow Your love; where there is injury, let me sow Your healing and forgiveness; where there is doubt, let me sow faith in You; where there is despair, let me sow hope in You; where there is darkness, let me sow Your light; where there is sadness, let me sow Your joy.</li>
  <li>Abba Father, I declare that this prayer will remain in effect from this point forward, that nothing can diminish its power or authority. I declare this as Child of the Living God and in the power and authority of my Lord, Master, Savior, Priest, King and Friend, Jesus Christ!</li>
</ul>
