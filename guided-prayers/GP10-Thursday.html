  <h3>ðŸŸ¦ Thursday â€“ Gratitude and Praise</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, thank You for who You are â€” not just what You do. You are good. You are faithful. You are worthy of my praise.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for waking me up today. For breath in my lungs, strength in my body, and hope in my heart.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, I donâ€™t want to take anything for granted. Thank You for the roof over my head, the food on my table, and the people in my life.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for the hard days â€” the ones that teach me, refine me, and draw me closer to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for the beautiful moments â€” the laughter, the breakthroughs, the peace, and the quiet joys that remind me of Your love.</li>
    <li>â–º God, thank You for not giving up on me. For pursuing me. For rescuing me. For redeeming what I thought was lost.</li>
    <li>â–º Jesus, thank You for the cross. For Your sacrifice. For loving me to the very end â€” and beyond.</li>
    <li>â–º Holy Spirit, thank You for guiding me, comforting me, and never leaving me alone in my struggles.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, I praise You for being constant in a changing world. You are my anchor. You are my rock. You are my firm foundation.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for answered prayers â€” and for the ones that didnâ€™t turn out like I expected. I trust Your wisdom more than my wants. I surrender to You will, not mine.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for the lessons Youâ€™ve taught me â€” even when they came through pain, delay, or discipline.</li>
    <li>â–º I praise You for the beauty in creation â€” the sunrise, the breeze, the stars, the colors, the stillness. You speak through all of it, to my heart with Love.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for Your mercy â€” new every morning. Undeserved. Unfailing. Unchanging. So appreciated!</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for the promises in Your Word â€” each one a reminder that You are faithful, even when I am not.</li>
    <li>â–º I praise You for the people Youâ€™ve placed in my life â€” those who have loved me, challenged me, prayed for me, and helped me grow.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for the work Youâ€™re doing in me â€” even when I canâ€™t see it. Even when I don't always cooperate with You. Youâ€™re not finished with me yet. And I am grateful that You are still at work.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, thank You for joy â€” not just the happy kind, but the deep, soul-rooted kind that comes from knowing You.</li>
    <li>â–º I praise You in advance for what Youâ€™re going to do â€” the doors Youâ€™ll open, the healing Youâ€™ll bring, the miracles Youâ€™ll perform.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for protecting me from things Iâ€™ll never even know about. You are always working behind the scenes.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for the strength to keep going â€” especially on the days I feel like giving up.</li>
    <li>â–º I praise You for peace â€” not the worldâ€™s kind, but the kind that guards my heart and mind in Christ Jesus.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for giving me a voice to worship You. Let my praise be sincere, loud, honest, and from the heart.</li>
    <li>â–º I choose gratitude today â€” not because everything is perfect, but because You are present, and thatâ€™s enough.</li>
    <li>â–º Let praise be my weapon today â€” against fear, against doubt, against darkness. You are greater than it all.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for being the Author and Finisher of my faith. You wrote the story â€” and I trust how Youâ€™re telling it. Please help me to cooperate with You today and everyday.</li>
