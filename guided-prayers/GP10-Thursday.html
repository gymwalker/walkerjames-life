  <h3>ðŸŸª Thursday â€“ Forgiveness and Cleansing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, I come to You with honesty. Search my heart and show me anything I need to confess or release. I want to walk in Your light, not hide in the shadows.</li>
    <li>â–º If thereâ€™s sin Iâ€™ve justified or ignored, bring it to the surface. Not to shame me â€” but to heal me. I want to be clean. I want to be whole.</li>
    <li>â–º Forgive me, Lord â€” not because I deserve it, but because Jesus paid for it. Cover me with His righteousness. Wash me in His mercy.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You that Your grace isnâ€™t stingy or reluctant â€” itâ€™s lavish. It meets me right where I am and never runs out.</li>
    <li>â–º I donâ€™t want to be casual with sin. I donâ€™t want to call it something less than what it is. Help me hate what You hate, and love what You love.</li>
    <li>â–º If thereâ€™s someone I need to forgive, help me let it go. Even if they never say sorry. Even if they donâ€™t deserve it. I forgive â€” because Iâ€™ve been forgiven.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, I donâ€™t want bitterness to live in me anymore. I donâ€™t want old wounds to define me. I give You every offense. Every betrayal. Every scar.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me forgive myself, too. Iâ€™ve carried guilt for far too long. But You donâ€™t ask me to fix it â€” You invite me to lay it down.</li>
    <li>â–º Teach me to forgive quickly and fully â€” not because itâ€™s easy, but because itâ€™s necessary for my freedom and Your glory.</li>
    <li>â–º If Iâ€™ve wounded someone else, give me the courage to make it right. Help me humble myself, apologize sincerely, and pursue peace.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You that Iâ€™m not defined by my worst moments. Thank You that You see me through the lens of Jesus â€” whole, holy, and beloved.</li>
    <li>â–º Let me live like someone whoâ€™s been set free. Let me walk in the confidence that grace has truly changed me.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, cleanse my thoughts, my motives, my patterns. I want to be renewed from the inside out â€” not just cleaned up on the outside.</li>
    <li>â–º If Iâ€™m tempted to shame others for their struggles, remind me how patient Youâ€™ve been with mine. Make me gentle. Make me kind.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You that repentance isnâ€™t a punishment â€” itâ€™s a gift. It brings me back into alignment with You. It heals what sin tried to destroy.</li>
    <li>â–º When the enemy tries to remind me of my past, remind me of the cross. Thatâ€™s where my sin died. Thatâ€™s where my new life began.</li>
    <li>â–º I receive Your forgiveness. I walk in Your grace. I stand in Your love â€” forgiven, restored, and made new by You.</li>
