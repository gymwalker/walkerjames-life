  <h3>🟨 Thursday – Worship and Gratitude</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, thank You for the breath in my lungs and the chance to live today for Your glory. I offer this day to You — guide it, shape it, and use it as You will.</li>
    <li>►⭐ Lord, I worship You not just for what You give, but for who You are — holy, faithful, just, merciful, powerful, patient, and good. You are worthy of praise even when my circumstances don’t change.</li>
    <li>► Lord, grow in me a deeper hunger for Your presence. Don’t let me settle for knowing about You — I want to walk with You, talk with You, and live in close communion with You.</li>
    <li>► Help me recognize the spiritual battles around me. Give me eyes to see the unseen — not to fear it, but to fight it with the power of Your truth and the authority of Your name.</li>
    <li>► Teach me how to walk in the Spirit — not in my flesh. Remind me that life and peace come from staying connected to You.</li>
    <li>► Strengthen my faith today. Let it not waver in difficulty or grow cold in routine. Let it be active, alive, and anchored in Your Word.</li>
    <li>► Lord, give me the wisdom I need to make the decisions in front of me. I don’t want to lean on my own understanding — I want to follow Your lead.</li>
    <li>► If I face temptation today, show me the way out — and give me the strength to take it. Help me not justify compromise but choose obedience.</li>
    <li>► Break any chains in my life that still hold me back — shame, fear, addiction, pride, insecurity, comparison, or regret. Set me free to walk in the fullness of who You’ve called me to be.</li>
    <li>► Fill my heart with compassion for those who are hurting, lost, lonely, or forgotten. Show me how to love them with Your love.</li>
    <li>► Lord, forgive me for the times I’ve acted like I didn’t need You. I do. I need You desperately — every hour, every moment, in every part of my life.</li>
    <li>► Help me to remember that victory doesn’t come from striving — it comes from surrendering to You.</li>
    <li>► Fill my home with peace. Let it be a place where You are honored, where kindness flows freely, and where people experience Your love.</li>
    <li>► Help me be patient with the people You’ve placed in my life — especially the ones who challenge me. Teach me to see them as You do.</li>
    <li>► Lord, I want to be a light in the darkness — not because I shine, but because You shine through me. Don’t let my life blend in; let it point to You.</li>
    <li>►⭐ Thank You for being faithful even when I don’t understand what You’re doing. Even when my prayers seem unanswered, I will choose to praise You because You are still God and still good.</li>
    <li>► Teach me how to rest — not just physically, but spiritually. Help me trust that You’re in control so I don’t carry what I’m not meant to carry.</li>
    <li>► Let my life bear fruit today — fruit that lasts, fruit that blesses others, fruit that reflects the Spirit who lives in me.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that I’m not defined by my past, my failures, or my struggles. I’m defined by You — by what You’ve done, what You’re doing, and who You say I am.</li>
    <li>► Father, keep my heart soft today. Don’t let it get hard, bitter, or calloused. Keep it open, teachable, and responsive to Your voice.</li>
    <li>► Lord, I declare that the enemy has no hold on me. I belong to You. I’ve been bought with the blood of Jesus, and I stand in His victory — not my own.</li>
    <li>► When the day gets hard or overwhelming, draw me back to You. Don’t let me react in the flesh — help me respond in the Spirit.</li>
    <li>► Help me love people well today — not because they deserve it, but because You’ve loved me first.</li>
    <li>► Teach me to honor You in my work — not just in ministry, but in every task I do. Let my excellence be worship to You.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that my time on earth is short. Help me live today in light of eternity, not temporary pleasures or problems.</li>
    <li>► Lord, give me courage to obey You even when I feel weak, scared, or uncertain. My job is obedience — the outcome belongs to You.</li>
    <li>► Father, I give You my disappointments, my delays, and my detours. Use them. Teach me through them. Let none of them be wasted.</li>
    <li>► Keep my words pure and life-giving today. Let me speak with grace, with truth, and with love — especially when it's hard.</li>
    <li>►⭐ Strip away any sense of entitlement or comparison in me, Lord. I want to live with open hands, grateful for whatever You give and content in every season.</li>
    <li>►⭐ Let my gratitude overflow in celebration. Teach me how to rejoice — to dance, to sing, to celebrate all that You are and all that You’ve done!</li>
    <li>►⭐ May my joy be so real, so unshakable, that it causes others to ask about You. Let my thankfulness be a witness to Your goodness and grace.</li>
    <li>► Father, thank You for loving me on my worst day. Thank You for never giving up on me. Thank You for always drawing me closer. You are my safe place, my strong tower, my everything.</li>
