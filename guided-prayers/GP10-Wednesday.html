  <li>Father, give me Your peace. Give me Your joy. Let me delight in Your pleasure. Strengthen me spiritually. Fill me with courage. Grant me wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. Pour out Your extreme favor and blessings over every part of my lifeâ€”at all times and in all things.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to appreciate You more deeply and be truly thankful for everything Youâ€™ve doneâ€”for me, for my family, and for all that You continue to do.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to appreciate You deeply, to be thankful for who You are, and to be truly grateful for everything Youâ€™ve done and continue to do for me.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to succeed in every task You place before meâ€”today and every day. Let me work with purpose, diligence, and joy as I follow Your lead.</li>
  <li>Father, claim my heart, my mind, and my life as Kingdom territoryâ€”fully ruled, fully reigned over, fully governed by You. Let nothing in me remain outside Your authority.</li>
  <li>Father, show me Your glory today. Open my eyes, my heart, my mind, and my soul to see You clearly and recognize what Youâ€™re doing. Help me surrender fully to You. Help me cooperateâ€”not resistâ€”what Youâ€™re doing in and through me and my life. Make me eternally minded in all we do today.</li>
  <li>Father, use me to make a difference for You todayâ€”in Your heart, in the lives of others, in my children, my family, my team, this world, and for Your Kingdom. I want to be Your tool, fully surrendered, fully usefulâ€”for Your glory today and every day.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to truly live as if You are my Lordâ€”the One with full authority over me, the One I serve, the One I obey. Be my Master. Be my King. Be my Lord. Be my God, Be my Savior. Be my Friend!</li>
  <li>Father, help me make and keep a covenant with my eyes, my heart, my mind, and my thoughtsâ€”to never lust after anyone who is not my spouse. Keep me pure. Guard my desires. Strengthen my resolve.</li>
  <li>Father, protect me and my family from deceiversâ€”those who lie, manipulate, and scheme to confuse our decisions and take advantage of us. Give me razor-sharp clarity to make the decisions You want me to make. Let no one twist, exploit, or prey on the kindness and generosity Youâ€™ve planted in my heart.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to be the Church the way You designed it to beâ€”not the way the world has distorted it. Keep me from shallow religion, performance, and people-pleasing. Let me honor You with Spirit-filled obedience, humble service, truth without compromise, and love without conditionâ€”just as You intended.</li>
  <li>Father, I choose this day to serve You fully. I askâ€”what do You want from me today? Show me clearly what Youâ€™ve assigned to my hands, and empower me with Your Spirit to accomplish it with excellence, joy, and devotion. Let nothing distract or delay what Youâ€™ve called me to do.</li>
  <li>Father, take full possession of my heart. Make it entirely, unquestionably, irrevocably Yours. Own me. Fill me. Unite me with You until we are inseparable in purpose, in spirit, and in love.</li>
  <li>Father, help me listen with compassion â€” not just to respond, but to understand. Let me speak Your truth in love, with clarity and courage, today and every day. Let every word reflect Your heart.</li>
  <li>Father, help me love others the way You love me â€” unconditionally, sacrificially, and without hesitation. Help me love what You love simply because You love it. Let Your heart shape mine.</li>
  <li>Father, help me recognize and avoid the tricks, traps, and temptations of the enemy. Keep me spiritually sharpâ€”mindful, alert, and anchored in You. Fully suited and armored up.</li>
  <li>Father, help me be faithful in prayerâ€”steadfast, consistent, and genuine. Let my prayers rise from a heart that longs to be with You, to hear from You, and to move with You.</li>
  <li>Help me fall more in love with You each and every dayâ€”to fall more in love with Your Son Jesus, to fall more in love with Your Spirit, and to fall more in love with all of who You are.</li>
  <li>Help me hear Your voice, know Your voice, respond to Your voiceâ€”and ignore anything that is not Your voice or from You.</li>
  <li>Help me read Your Word and grow in wisdom, knowledge, understanding, and trust of You.</li>
  <li>Father, keep my attitude and my actions aligned with Yours â€” shaped by Your heart, led by Your Spirit, and guided by Your truth.</li>
  <li>Father, make my heart good soilâ€”soft, open, and readyâ€”where You can plant Your Word and grow a harvest that glorifies You. Let what Youâ€™ve planted in me take deep root, grow strong, and bear lasting fruit. Nourish me daily with Your presence, Your Word, and Your Spiritâ€”and let that nourishment overflow to bless others too.</li>
  <li>Fill me with a deep, unshakable desire for Youâ€”Your Word, Your Son Jesus, and Your Holy Spirit. Stir my heart to long for all of who You are, Father, and let that desire shape every part of my life.</li>
  <li>Fill me with Your Spirit, Your Truth, Your Love, Your Mercy, Your Grace, Your Joy, Your Peace, and Your Comfort. Fill me with all of You so that I may reflect Jesus clearly, perfectly. Let every part of me point others back to You.</li>
  <li>Give me confidence in Your sufficiency. Youâ€™ve already given me everything I need to live for Youâ€”to serve You, love You, obey You, honor You, glorify Youâ€”and to become all that You created me to be.</li>
  <li>Give me the courage to walk through every door You openâ€”trusting that whatâ€™s on the other side is part of Your best for me, Your perfect plan for me.</li>
  <li>Give me Your patience to wait on Youâ€”and to trust Your timing and Your answers to my prayers, my passions, and my desires.</li>
  <li>Help me be a good communicator with Youâ€”to speak freely and share my heart, my thoughts, and my love with You. Help me to never hold back.</li>
