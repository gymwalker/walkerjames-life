  <h3>🟨 Wednesday – Wisdom and Guidance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, I so need Your wisdom today — not just to make decisions, but to live well and love well in every moment.</li>
    <li>► Help me tune out the noise of the world and tune into the still, small voice of You and Your Spirit.</li>
    <li>► If I’m facing choices, give me clarity. If I’m confused, give me wisdom and peace. If I’m tempted to rush, help me wait on You.</li>
    <li>► Lord, show me what’s real, what matters, and what aligns with Your heart, with Your will. Let me see through Your eyes today.</li>
    <li>► Teach me to listen — not just to respond, but to understand. Not just to people, but to You.</li>
    <li>► If there’s anything in my life that’s distracting me from Your truth, bring it to light — and help me surrender it fully to You.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, help me discern between good, better, and best — not everything that’s available is beneficial. Help me to always want Your best for me.</li>
    <li>► Let my words be wise, not just clever. Let my actions reflect heaven’s priorities, not just earth’s patterns.</li>
    <li>► Holy Spirit, guide me in conversations, in decisions, in reactions, and in moments when I feel unsure.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that guidance isn’t just about answers — it’s about walking closely with the One who leads, the One who has all the answers.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve been relying too much on my own understanding, forgive me. I choose to lean on You and Your understanding instead.</li>
    <li>► Father, help me prioritize what’s eternal over what’s urgent. Let me steward this day, for Your glory, not just survive it.</li>
    <li>► Give me courage to act on what I know is right — even if it’s inconvenient, unpopular, or uncomfortable. Help me to stand firm in Your truth.</li>
    <li>► If I’m afraid of making the wrong move, remind me that You can redirect me if I stay surrendered.</li>
    <li>► Teach me to be still before You — to wait without striving, to trust without panic, to surrender without worry.</li>
    <li>► Lord, speak to my heart through Scripture today. Let it be alive and active in Your spirit that lives in me — sharper than any human opinion.</li>
    <li>► If I’m heading down a path that’s not Your best for me, gently course-correct me. Even a whisper from You is enough.</li>
    <li>► Give me divine insight today — not just intelligence, but discernment rooted in Your truth and grace.</li>
    <li>► Let my “yes” be to You first, before anyone else. Make Your voice the loudest and most trusted one in my life.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, if I’ve been spiritually distracted, center me again on You and Your Kingdom. Let me crave connection with You more than comfort or control.</li>
    <li>► Help me embrace godly counsel. Let me learn from the wise, receive correction with humility, and grow from feedback.</li>
    <li>► Lord, don’t let me just seek direction — let me seek You. You are the way. You are the truth. You are life.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve been asking the wrong questions, shift my focus. Teach me to care more about becoming than arriving.</li>
    <li>► Guide me in how I love others today — not just to be kind, but to be holy. Not just helpful, but Christlike. Encourage me to give grace abundantly to others.</li>
    <li>► Thank You for leading me one step at a time. Even when I don’t see the whole road, I trust the One lighting my path.</li>
  </ul>
