  <h3>ðŸŸª Wednesday â€“ Strength and Courage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, I surrender every part of who I am to You today â€” my heart, my will, my thoughts, my emotions, my desires, my schedule, and my plans. Lead me where You want me to go and help me obey without hesitation.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, deepen my love for You today. Let it not be based on feelings, but grounded in truth â€” that You are worthy of all my love, all my trust, all my obedience.</li>
    <li>â–º Teach me to listen â€” not just talk. I want to hear Your voice above all others. Help me quiet the noise in my life so I can be still before You and truly know You.</li>
    <li>â–º Fill me with wisdom and discernment â€” to know right from wrong, truth from lies, and to walk in the light no matter what darkness I face.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me reject everything that pulls me away from You. Let me not compromise my faith, my values, or my integrity for temporary comfort or gain.</li>
    <li>â–º Teach me to love Your Word â€” to hunger for it, to meditate on it, and to live by it. Help me build my life on Your truth, not on my feelings or opinions.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me courage to stand firm when Iâ€™m tested â€” to choose what honors You even when itâ€™s hard or unpopular.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, I invite You into every conversation, every relationship, every task today. Be present with me. Work through me. Speak through me. Love through me.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me forgive quickly and fully â€” just as You have forgiven me. Donâ€™t let bitterness, offense, or resentment find any room in my heart.</li>
    <li>â–º Show me who needs encouragement today â€” and give me the words, the compassion, and the time to show up for them.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, let Your joy be my strength today. No matter what comes, help me rejoice in who You are and what Youâ€™ve already done for me.</li>
    <li>â–º Make me aware of the spiritual battle around me â€” and keep me grounded in the truth that the victory already belongs to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me stay humble â€” not thinking less of myself, but thinking of myself less. Let me live to serve, not to be served.</li>
    <li>â–º Holy Spirit, produce Your fruit in me today â€” especially where I struggle most. Let love replace irritation, joy replace frustration, and peace replace anxiety.</li>
    <li>â–º Show me how to use my time wisely. Help me not to waste it on things that donâ€™t matter. Teach me to number my days and live with eternal purpose.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, help me be patient â€” with others, with circumstances, and with myself. Remind me that You are still working even when I donâ€™t see it.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me put others first today â€” not because I have to, but because thatâ€™s who You are and who Youâ€™re making me to be.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, protect my heart from distractions â€” especially good things that keep me from the best things. Teach me to focus on what truly matters.</li>
    <li>â–º Let me find my identity in You alone â€” not in what I do, what others think, or how I feel, but in who You say I am.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me be generous â€” with my words, my time, my resources, and my grace. Youâ€™ve given me so much; help me not to hold back.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me eyes to see people the way You see them â€” broken but beloved, lost but pursued, messy but made in Your image.</li>
    <li>â–º Remind me that Iâ€™m not alone â€” that You are with me, for me, and in me, and that I have nothing to fear.</li>
    <li>â–º Let my attitude be one of gratitude. Open my eyes to the gifts Youâ€™ve already given me â€” and help me live from a place of thankfulness.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, donâ€™t let me settle. Stir up a holy hunger in me to know You more, love You more, and reflect You more every single day.</li>
    <li>â–º Shape my heart to long for You more than anything this world offers. You are my portion. You are my reward.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me honor You with my thoughts, my words, my body, my choices, and my time. Let my whole life be worship to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Use my hands to serve someone today. Let me be the answer to someoneâ€™s prayer â€” the encouragement, the provision, the helping hand they needed.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, refine me. Search me and show me what needs to change â€” even if itâ€™s painful. I want to become more like Jesus.</li>
    <li>â–º Let Your Spirit lead me in every step today. I donâ€™t want to run ahead or fall behind. Keep me in sync with Your will.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You, Father, for Your mercy thatâ€™s new every morning. No matter what happened yesterday, Youâ€™ve given me a fresh start today â€” and I want to live it for You.</li>
