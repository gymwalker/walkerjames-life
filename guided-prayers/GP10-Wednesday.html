  <h3>Wednesday...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, I surrender every part of who I am to You today — my heart, my will, my thoughts, my emotions, my desires, my schedule, and my plans. Lead me where You want me to go and help me obey without hesitation.</li>
    <li>► Lord, deepen my love for You today. Let it not be based on feelings, but grounded in truth — that You are worthy of all my love, all my trust, all my obedience.</li>
    <li>► Teach me to listen — not just talk. I want to hear Your voice above all others. Help me quiet the noise in my life so I can be still before You and truly know You.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with wisdom and discernment — to know right from wrong, truth from lies, and to walk in the light no matter what darkness I face.</li>
    <li>► Help me reject everything that pulls me away from You. Let me not compromise my faith, my values, or my integrity for temporary comfort or gain.</li>
    <li>► Teach me to love Your Word — to hunger for it, to meditate on it, and to live by it. Help me build my life on Your truth, not on my feelings or opinions.</li>
    <li>► Give me courage to stand firm when I’m tested — to choose what honors You even when it’s hard or unpopular.</li>
    <li>► Lord, I invite You into every conversation, every relationship, every task today. Be present with me. Work through me. Speak through me. Love through me.</li>
    <li>► Help me forgive quickly and fully — just as You have forgiven me. Don’t let bitterness, offense, or resentment find any room in my heart.</li>
    <li>► Show me who needs encouragement today — and give me the words, the compassion, and the time to show up for them.</li>
    <li>► Father, let Your joy be my strength today. No matter what comes, help me rejoice in who You are and what You’ve already done for me.</li>
    <li>► Make me aware of the spiritual battle around me — and keep me grounded in the truth that the victory already belongs to You.</li>
    <li>► Help me stay humble — not thinking less of myself, but thinking of myself less. Let me live to serve, not to be served.</li>
    <li>► Holy Spirit, produce Your fruit in me today — especially where I struggle most. Let love replace irritation, joy replace frustration, and peace replace anxiety.</li>
    <li>► Show me how to use my time wisely. Help me not to waste it on things that don’t matter. Teach me to number my days and live with eternal purpose.</li>
    <li>► Lord, help me be patient — with others, with circumstances, and with myself. Remind me that You are still working even when I don’t see it.</li>
    <li>► Help me put others first today — not because I have to, but because that’s who You are and who You’re making me to be.</li>
    <li>► Lord, protect my heart from distractions — especially good things that keep me from the best things. Teach me to focus on what truly matters.</li>
    <li>► Let me find my identity in You alone — not in what I do, what others think, or how I feel, but in who You say I am.</li>
    <li>► Help me be generous — with my words, my time, my resources, and my grace. You’ve given me so much; help me not to hold back.</li>
    <li>► Give me eyes to see people the way You see them — broken but beloved, lost but pursued, messy but made in Your image.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that I’m not alone — that You are with me, for me, and in me, and that I have nothing to fear.</li>
    <li>► Let my attitude be one of gratitude. Open my eyes to the gifts You’ve already given me — and help me live from a place of thankfulness.</li>
    <li>► Father, don’t let me settle. Stir up a holy hunger in me to know You more, love You more, and reflect You more every single day.</li>
    <li>► Shape my heart to long for You more than anything this world offers. You are my portion. You are my reward.</li>
    <li>► Help me honor You with my thoughts, my words, my body, my choices, and my time. Let my whole life be worship to You.</li>
    <li>► Use my hands to serve someone today. Let me be the answer to someone’s prayer — the encouragement, the provision, the helping hand they needed.</li>
    <li>► Lord, refine me. Search me and show me what needs to change — even if it’s painful. I want to become more like Jesus.</li>
    <li>► Let Your Spirit lead me in every step today. I don’t want to run ahead or fall behind. Keep me in sync with Your will.</li>
    <li>► Thank You, Father, for Your mercy that’s new every morning. No matter what happened yesterday, You’ve given me a fresh start today — and I want to live it for You.</li>
