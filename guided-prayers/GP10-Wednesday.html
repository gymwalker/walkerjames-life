  <h3>ðŸŸ¨ Wednesday â€“ Provision and Trust</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Father, I trust You to meet my needs today â€” not just physically, but spiritually, emotionally, relationally, and financially. You are my source.</li>
    <li>â–º You already know what I need before I ask. Still, I bring my requests before You â€” not because Youâ€™ve forgotten, but because I want to depend on You fully.</li>
    <li>â–º Provide what I need for today â€” not what I want for tomorrow. Keep my heart from wandering into fear or greed. Teach me to be content with todayâ€™s manna.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, when I feel anxious about money, bills, or the future, remind me that You clothe the lilies and feed the birds â€” and I am worth so much more to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me manage what Youâ€™ve already provided with wisdom and stewardship. Let me not waste or hoard, but use it to honor You and bless others.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, I surrender my career, my calling, my income, and my identity to You. Provide opportunities that align with Your will and bring You glory.</li>
    <li>â–º If You are leading me into something new â€” even if it feels risky or uncertain â€” help me trust Your voice over my comfort zone.</li>
    <li>â–º Jesus, help me believe that what I have right now is enough for today. Tomorrow will worry about itself. I choose to live in the grace of this moment.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, when Iâ€™m tempted to believe that Youâ€™ve forgotten me, remind me of all the ways Youâ€™ve shown up before â€” Youâ€™ve never failed me yet.</li>
    <li>â–º Open my eyes to see unexpected provision â€” the kindness of others, a moment of peace, a word of encouragement, a door I didnâ€™t see coming.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me not just pray for provision â€” but also be someone You use to provide for others. Show me where I can give, share, and support today.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, I release my scarcity mindset. You are not a God of lack. You own the cattle on a thousand hills. Teach me to live like I believe that.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You for caring about my practical needs. Youâ€™re not distant from my daily struggles. You walk with me through every grocery list and medical bill.</li>
    <li>â–º Lord, I pray for those who are without â€” without food, shelter, income, or support. Use me to be an answer to their prayer, even if it costs me something.</li>
    <li>â–º Provide me with wisdom for every financial decision. Let me seek Your counsel before I spend, give, save, or invest.</li>
    <li>â–º You are Jehovah Jireh â€” my provider. Not just once, but every day. And not just with money â€” but with peace, strength, healing, and hope.</li>
    <li>â–º Fill the gaps in my life that no amount of money could ever fix. Let my heart be rich in the things that matter most to You.</li>
    <li>â–º Let my gratitude be louder than my needs today. Let me see the blessing already in my hands â€” and worship You for it.</li>
  </ul>
