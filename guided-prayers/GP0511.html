<h2>A Prayer of Gratitude for Being Made New</h2>

<p>God, thank You for not leaving me where You found me. Thank You for stepping into my brokenness, my rebellion, my mess — and loving me through it. Thank You for the cross that didn’t just forgive my sin, but made a way for me to become someone new. I’m not who I used to be — and that’s only because of You.</p>

<p>You didn’t just clean me up; You gave me a new heart. A new spirit. A new name. A new future. You called me out of darkness and into light. You exchanged my shame for honor, my guilt for grace, my fear for peace. You’ve redefined my identity — not based on my past, but based on Your love. And for that, I’m overwhelmed with gratitude.</p>

<p>Help me live like someone who’s been made new. Help me to walk in the freedom You’ve given me — not going back to old chains, not living under old lies. Remind me daily that I am a new creation. That the old has gone, and the new has come. Fill me with joy every time I remember where You brought me from. And let that joy overflow into praise.</p>

<p>God, I want to honor You with this new life. I want to use it to serve, to love, to bless, to shine Your light and Your love everywhere I go. I want people to see me and know that something is different — not because I’m better, but because I’ve been redeemed. Let my story be a testimony of Your mercy. Let my life point to Your grace.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a fresh start, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I live each day in gratitude for the transformation You’ve done in me. One where being made new is not just a moment, but a lifestyle of walking with You.</p>

<p>Thank You for making all things new — especially me.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
