<h2>A Prayer for Someone Who’s Lost Their Way</h2>

<p>Father, I bring before You someone I care about deeply — someone who’s wandered far from the path You’ve laid before them. I don’t know all the reasons why. Maybe life got hard. Maybe wounds went unhealed. Maybe they just stopped believing You were good. But You know every detail of their story. You see what I can’t. And You still love them more than I ever could.</p>

<p>They may feel distant from You, but You are not distant from them. Even in their silence, You are still speaking. Even in their rebellion, You are still reaching. You are the Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine to search for the one. And so I’m asking You to do what only You can — find them, meet them, and bring them home to You.</p>

<p>Break through every wall they’ve built. Tear down every lie they’ve believed. Surround them with people who will speak truth with love not judgement. Use whatever You need — a conversation, a memory, a scripture, a moment of quiet — to remind them of who You are and who they are to You.</p>

<p>And Lord, if there’s a role for me in their restoration, help me say yes, I make myself available to You. Give me wisdom to know when to speak and when to stay silent. Give me grace to love without conditions. And give me endurance to keep praying, even when it feels like nothing is changing.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just for me, but for them. I want them to desire what You desire, I want them to want what You want, a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate, relationship with You. I also want for them a restored heart, a renewed mind, and a relationship with You that is stronger than anything they’ve ever known. Bring the right people, the right words, the right moments to light the way back. And while You’re working in them, keep working in me — growing my patience, my hope, and my faith in Your perfect timing.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
