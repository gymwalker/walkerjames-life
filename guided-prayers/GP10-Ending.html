  <li>Father, I declare that sin is not my master. You alone are Lord over my life, and I refuse to let sin have any rule, reign, or influence over me today.</li>
  <li>I surrender every part of my body to You—my mind, my mouth, my hands, my feet, my thoughts, and my desires. Let everything in me be devoted to Your glory.</li>
  <li>I know I cannot do this on my own. But You can. So I invite You—live in me, and live through me. Let Your righteousness be my strength and Your Spirit my guide.</li>
  <li>My Lord and my God and my King Jesus, I put my trust in You to fight my battles. There is nothing in this world that can separate me from Your love. Grow and strengthen my trust in You.</li>
  <li>Since I know that Your power and authority has been given to me by the cross of Jesus Christ, show Your power and authority in and through me. Provide for my needs, protect me, and fill me with Your strength, love, and wisdom.</li>
  <li>Father, help me resist the lure and temptation of pride—thinking of myself as more important than I am. Help me never steal or desire Your glory or what belongs to You. Teach me to always give You full credit and never misrepresent You.</li>
  <li>Father, protect me from lust and the desires of my flesh. Help me not to give in to selfish, self-centered passions. Let my life honor and glorify You. May everything I do bring glory to Your name.</li>
  <li>Father, give me strong, powerful, steady confidence in You—like Elisha had. Help me trust You in all things, to see this life as temporary, and to focus fully on serving and glorifying You.</li>
  <li>Father God, You’ve shown me what matters most—seeking You and Your Kingdom first, loving You with all that I am, and loving others the way You love me.</li>
  <li>Father, help me to live my purpose today—to love and glorify You, to love others, to be like Jesus, to serve You and Your kingdom, and to tell others about Your fierce love for them, to be holy as You are holy, to be filled with the Holy Spirit at all times, and to be grateful for everything You are doing and have done in my life.</li>

    <strong>Heavenly Father, I put on Your full armor:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The belt of truth</strong> — to hold everything together and guard me from deception; to remind me that truth is found in You alone.</li>
      <li><strong>The breastplate of righteousness</strong> — to protect my heart and keep it aligned with Your purity and holiness, not my own efforts.</li>
      <li><strong>The gospel of peace</strong> — as shoes for my feet, grounding me in the message of hope, reconciliation, and readiness to walk wherever You send me.</li>
      <li><strong>The shield of faith</strong> — to extinguish every fiery dart of fear, doubt, accusation, and temptation hurled at me by the enemy.</li>
      <li><strong>The helmet of salvation</strong> — to guard my mind, my thoughts, and my identity in Christ, reminding me I belong to You and that my eternity is secure.</li>
      <li><strong>The sword of the Spirit — Your Word</strong> — to cut through lies, defeat the enemy’s schemes, and strike back with truth, power, precision, and divine authority.</li>
      <li><strong>The power of prayer</strong> — to stay in constant communion with You, to align my will with Yours, and to call Heaven down into my situation, and to come to the assistance of others as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>The power of praise and worship</strong> — to shift the atmosphere, silence the enemy, and magnify You above everything else.</li>
      <li><strong>The power of the blood of Jesus</strong> — my ultimate covering, my victory, and my authority. Nothing can stand against the blood of my Savior — Jesus Christ.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make me an instrument of Your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow Your love; where there is injury, let me sow Your healing and forgiveness; where there is doubt, let me sow faith in You; where there is despair, let me sow hope in You; where there is darkness, let me sow Your light; where there is sadness, let me sow Your joy.</li>
  <li>Abba Father, I declare that this prayer will remain in effect from this point forward, that nothing can diminish its power or authority. I declare this as Child of the Living God and in the power and authority of my Lord, Master, Savior, Priest, King and Friend, Jesus Christ!</li>
</ul>
