<h2>A Prayer of Forgiveness and Cleansing</h2>

<p>Father God, Most High and Most Holy — before I pick up any weapon, before I engage in any battle, I come to You first… to be cleansed. I know that the enemy gains access to what I refuse to surrender, and I don’t want to go into this fight carrying anything that doesn’t belong to You. So I humble myself before You and ask — search me, oh God. Test me. Expose what’s hidden. Shine Your light on every shadow in me that I’ve tolerated, excused, ignored, or justified. And convict me specifically of anything that needs to be confessed, repented of, and wiped clean by the cleansing power of the Blood of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Forgive me, Lord, for every sin — the ones I see and the ones I’ve been blind to. The attitudes. The pride. The envy. The harsh words. The impatience. The compromise. The lust. The laziness. The rebellion. The unforgiveness. The fear I’ve allowed to rule. The comfort I’ve prioritized over obedience. The people I’ve hurt. The truth I’ve resisted. The time I’ve wasted. The things I’ve chosen instead of You. Forgive me.</p>

<p>Right now, in the name of Jesus, I come out of agreement with every sin and every stronghold the enemy may hold on any piece of Your property Lord Jesus. I renounce it. I reject it. I release it. I repent — not just with words, but with my heart. I turn. I change direction. I surrender again. I break every legal right the enemy has to use against me through these open doors. I plead the blood of Jesus over every place where I’ve fallen, and I thank You that His blood is enough. Enough to forgive. Enough to cleanse. Enough to restore what I’ve broken.</p>

<p>If there’s anything I’ve called normal that You call sin — show me. If there’s anything I’ve buried that You want to heal — uncover it. If there’s any habit I’ve protected that You want to destroy — break it. I give You permission to wreck anything in me that’s been giving the enemy room to move, to hurt, to harm, to kill, to destroy. You are a holy God — and I want to be a holy warrior. Set apart. Washed clean. Forgiven and free from any and all sin.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, please fill any part of me that has been emptied by the enemy we just evicted. Plant Your truth, Your wisdom. Your words. Your love. Your care. Your kindness. Your generocity. In every empty room You can find.</p>

<p>Jesus, thank You for never giving up on me. Thank You that repentance doesn’t lead to shame — it leads to freedom. It leads to power. It leads to victory. Fill me again with Your Spirit. Align me with Your heart. Seal me in Your righteousness. And clothe me in the authority that only comes from a life fully surrendered to You.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a heart that’s pure, a soul that’s free, a life that’s Yours, and a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Make me clean, make me ready, and make me dangerous to the kingdom of darkness — because I stand in Your light that blinds them and fills them with the absolute fear and terror of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
