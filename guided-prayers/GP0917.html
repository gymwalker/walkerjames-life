<h2>A Prayer for Strength When You’re Spiritually Exhausted</h2>

<p>Most Gracious Heavenly Father, I come before You weary. Not in rebellion. Not in distance. Just… tired. Tired from the fight. Tired from the battle. Tired from waiting. Tired from carrying burdens, praying prayers, standing in the gap, and showing up — even when no one sees. My spirit feels drained. My heart feels heavy. And I know that the only strength that will sustain me right now… is Yours.</p>

<p>You said, “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” So I come. I come not with eloquent words, but with empty hands. I bring You my fatigue, my frustration, my discouragement, my questions, and even the silence that sometimes scares me. I lay them at Your feet — and I ask to trade them in for Your strength. Not just enough to survive, but enough to rise. Enough to continue the fight. Enough to continue the battle. Enough to run again. Enough to believe again. Enough to hope again. Enough to smile again.</p>

<p>Father, I renounce the lie that being tired means I’m failing.  
I renounce the guilt that whispers I should be stronger by now.  
I renounce the shame of needing help, of not being strong enough.  
And I renounce the pressure to keep pretending I have it all together, because I don't.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, fill every depleted place.  
Where there’s burnout — bring renewal.  
Where there’s numbness — restore tenderness.  
Where there’s fog — bring clarity.  
Where there’s heaviness — breathe joy.  
Let rest become worship. Let stillness become strength. Let my weakness become a doorway to Your power.</p>

<p>Jesus, thank You for being my refuge — not just in crisis, but in exhaustion. Thank You for never being disappointed in my limits. Thank You for being gentle with me when I’m running on empty. You never told me to keep going without You. So I pause now… to lean on You again. Carry me where I can’t walk. Hold me when I can’t hold anything together. Sing over me when I can’t even form the words to pray. Keep me by Your side. Hold my hand to keep me from running a head of You, or falling behind You. Show me, guide me, teach me, love me.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just strength for today, but connection with You in the middle of my weakness. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — not powered by effort, but anchored in trust and surrender. Make me strong in You. And if all I can do today is be still and know that You are God, being in Your presence, then that is more than enough.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
