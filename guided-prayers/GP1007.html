<h3>⬛ Sunday...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Abba Father, I accept Your invitation into perfect union — Father, Son, and Spirit. Let my life reflect the love and oneness You share. I want nothing less than to dwell in the center of that holy intimacy every moment.</li>
  <li>Unite with me today. Surround me, fill me, and flow through me. Let my thoughts, my choices, and my worship be a living reflection of Your Spirit, Your love, and Your truth alive in me.</li>
  <li>Consume every part of me. Take all of me. Possess all of me. Empower me to live a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ—completely led by You.</li>
  <li>Help me invest deeply in my relationship with You. Let seeking, knowing, and walking with You be my highest priority and greatest pursuit every day.</li>
  <li>Holy Spirit, overflow me with Your love, Your presence, and Your heart for others. Let my life be marked by Your influence—guiding my words and shaping my actions to reflect Jesus.</li>
  <li>Lead me away from fear, distraction, and lesser desires. Fix my focus on You and Your Kingdom — not the temporary, but the eternal. Guide me by Your Spirit, with clarity and peace, into all that You have for me today.</li>
  <li>Father, fill me with wisdom, insight, discernment, discipline, and shalom peace in everything I do—for You and with You. Let my actions be shaped by Your Spirit, not my flesh.</li>
  <li>Father, awaken every spiritual sense within me. Open my eyes to eternal things. Give me supernatural perception so I may see, know, and respond to what truly matters to You.</li>
  <li>Let me taste and see that You are good. Make Your presence and Your Kingdom more real to me than anything this world could ever offer.</li>
  <li>Father, I’m overwhelmed by Your grace. My only worthy response is worship. Thank You for choosing me, adopting me, redeeming me, and revealing the beauty of Your gospel.</li>
  <li>Thank You, Jesus, for giving me Your power, Your strength, and Your authority to affect this world for Your Kingdom and Your Glory. Let me live today fully aligned with You, walking in Your presence and depending on Your Spirit.</li>
  <li>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit — I long for Your return, for the day You rule and reign over all. May Your Kingdom come quickly. Let my heart be found ready, watching, and full of faith.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Lord, shape my heart so deeply that even my attitude becomes an offering of worship — not just in what I say or do, but in how I think, respond, endure, and love. Let the posture of my soul reflect Your worthiness at all times, especially when no one else sees.</li>
    <li>Lord, let Your light shine so powerfully in me that it overflows through every word, action, and moment. Make it undeniable. Let those around me see You in the way I live, and be drawn not to me — but to You — because Your presence in me awakens something in them they didn’t know they were missing.</li>
    <li>Lord, let Your unfailing love and the power of Your Spirit lead my thoughts, guide my steps, and direct every decision I make — not just in moments of clarity, but especially in the chaos. Teach me to lean into You so fully that I never move without Your whisper.</li>
    <li>Lord Jesus, never let me forget that without You, I am nothing, deserve nothing, and can do nothing of eternal worth. You are my source, my strength, and my joy. Teach me to be content in every circumstance — not because life is easy, but because You are enough. Help me treasure You above all else.</li>
    <li>Lord, I want to be fully engaged in what You’re doing in Your Kingdom, not just busy with my own plans. Without You, my efforts are empty. Lead me, fill me, and use me as You will. Feed my soul with Your presence, and let that overflow to nourish others. Keep my heart fixed on You, and make me a vessel through which Your goodness flows freely into the lives around me.</li>
    <li>May Your Kingdom come, Lord — not just in the world around me, but in my heart, my home, and my choices. Stir in me a deep desire for what matters to You. Teach me to live as a citizen of Heaven now, and to serve Your Kingdom with humility, passion, and purpose.</li>
    <li>Lord, never let me forget the depth of Your love for me. Open my eyes daily to see it, remind my heart constantly to feel it, and anchor my soul in the truth that I am deeply, unshakably loved by You — even on the days I don’t feel worthy of it.</li>
    <li>Lord, there are temptations to sin everywhere. Help me not to give in to any of them. Make me sensitive to the ways of escape that You provide, and be quick to take them. I want my love for You—and for others—to be genuine, alive, and so deeply rooted in You that it draws people closer to Your heart.</li>
    <li>Lord, uproot every trace of laziness, stubbornness, selfishness, procrastination, doubt, anger, frustration, and offense from my heart. Strip away anything in me that doesn’t look like You — and in its place, fill me with the tender, patient, compassionate kindness of Jesus, so that everything I do reflects Your love.</li>
    <li>Father, take my will and make it Yours. Shape my heart to beat with Your love, and renew my mind to think with Your wisdom. Fill every part of me with Your Holy Spirit until I am fully aligned with You. I long to live in deep, unbroken union with You.</li>
    <li>Revive me today and every day, Lord — awaken my heart, renew my passion, and fill me with fresh fire to live for You. Let my life be a clear reflection of Jesus, so that anyone who sees me can’t help but see Him, and fall in Love with Him.</li>
    <li>Today, quiet my soul, Lord. Still the noise within me so I can truly remember who You are — sovereign, faithful, unshaken. In the stillness, help me rest in the truth that You are God... and that is enough.</li>
    <li>Wherever I go and whatever I do, Lord, let my life reflect You with honesty, humility, and grace. Help me walk with such integrity and love that others can clearly see who You are — because they’ve seen You in me.</li>
    <li>Lord, use this day to draw me closer to You. Take first place in my heart, reveal Yourself more clearly, and deepen my understanding of who You are. Let my love for You grow richer, fuller, and more complete — and may my life reflect You with honesty and grace. Keep sin far from me — from my heart, from my walk with You, and from every relationship I touch.</li>
    <li>Make this a two-way conversation, Lord. I don’t just want to speak — I want to listen. Help me hear Your thoughts, sense Your nudges, respond to Your whispers, and wait on You with a heart that’s fully engaged. Teach me to listen to You… and for You. Then help me to respond obediently.</li>
    <li>Sow Your Word deep into every part of me — my heart, my thoughts, my choices, and my soul. Let it take root and grow strong, producing the strength I need to stand, the courage to follow You fully, and the wisdom to walk in Your ways every day.</li>
    <li>Lord, deepen my faith until it’s unshakable, and draw me so close that nothing matters more than being with You. Strengthen the roots of our relationship until I know You, trust You, and walk with You more fully than ever before.</li>
    <li>Lord, take the anger and frustration that poison my peace, and strip away every selfish desire that pulls me from You. Empty me of what is not from You, and fill me with Your patience, Your purpose, and Your perfect love.</li>
    <li>Give me the wisdom and discernment to recognize and see the open doors You place before me — and the courage to walk through them with faith, obedience, and full dependence on You.</li>
    <li>I surrender fully to You and to Your will for my life. Let every part of who I am bring honor and glory to Your name — always. Shape me into a vessel You can trust, and help me walk in full, joyful cooperation with everything You desire to do in me and through me.</li>
    <li>Lord, when frustration rises and anger knocks at my door, guard my heart and slow my reactions. Teach me to respond with grace instead of rage, and to choose patience over pride. Fill me with Your peace so I reflect You even in the heat of the moment.</li>
    <li>Lord, I don’t want anything to stand between me and the fullness of relationship You desire for me. Help me let go of every distraction, fear, habit, or mindset that blocks the absolute best relationship with You — and with the people You've placed in my life. Nothing matters more than the love that flows freely from You, through me.</li>
    <li>Lord, I want to walk with You today — not ahead of You, not behind You, and never against You. Help me stay in step with Your Spirit, fully available for whatever You desire. Let my heart, my time, and my life be Yours to use, as You will. I don’t just want to believe in You — I want to cooperate with You.</li>
    <li>Lord, let Your Word take root in me — not just as truth I know, but as life I live. Let it shape my thoughts, guide my actions, and flow through me so powerfully that others encounter You in what I say and do.</li>
    <li>Lord, give me the kind of faith that moves when You speak — faith that trusts Your calling even when it feels beyond me. Strengthen my heart to step into everything You’ve prepared for me, knowing that if You’ve called me to it, You’ll carry me through it.</li>
    <li>My Lord, my God, and my King Jesus — I surrender fully to You and to Your will for my life. Today and every day, I lay everything I have and everything I am at Your feet. Use me as You please. Shape my heart to serve You and others with joy, humility, and complete obedience. I am all Yours.</li>
    <li>Mighty God, protect me from every scheme, lie, and attack of the enemy. Surround me with Your angels, cover me with the blood of Jesus, and strengthen me to stand firm in Your truth. Be my shield, my refuge, and my defender — for no weapon formed against me will prevail when I am hidden in You.</li>
    <li>Father, keep me out of Your way. Don’t let my doubts, fears, pride, or impatience interfere with what You’re doing in my life. Do whatever You must to accomplish Your will — just don’t let me sabotage it. I want what You want.</li>
