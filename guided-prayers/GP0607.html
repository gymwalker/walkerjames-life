<h2>A Prayer for My Daughter</h2>

<p>Father, thank You for the incredible gift of my daughter, what a blessing, what a treasure. Thank You for her heart, her beauty, her tenderness, her strength, her laughter, and the light she carries. She is Your daughter before she is mine — fearfully and wonderfully made, set apart for a purpose only You can fully see. And yet, You chose me to help raise her, to love her, to protect her, and to lead her. What an honor… and what a humbling responsibility.</p>

<p>I lift her to You now. Guard her heart, Father — not just from harm, but from lies. Lies about her worth, her beauty, her purpose, or her identity. Let her know in the deepest places that she is not defined by comparison, culture, or attention, but by her Creator. Root her in Your love so firmly that no compliment can inflate her and no criticism can shatter her. Let her see herself as You see her — chosen, cherished, strong, and radiant in grace.</p>

<p>Help me, Father, to love her well. Not to control, but to cover. Not to smother, but to shepherd. Help me know when to step in and when to let her fly. Teach me to affirm her with my words and my presence, so she never has to look elsewhere to feel seen. Let my voice echo Yours — one of love, truth, and blessing — so the world’s noise never drowns out her calling.</p>

<p>Show me how to raise her into the woman You created her to be — not the one I fear the world may demand, but the one You’ve already called by name. Let me encourage her courage, protect her innocence, and cultivate her strength without ever dimming her gentleness. Help me to teach her that her greatest beauty is the light of Jesus shining through her — and that no filter, mirror, or spotlight can compare to the glory of a heart fully surrendered to You.</p>

<p>Help me make the most of our time. Let me be present in her joys and her tears, available in her questions, and steady in her storms. Help me live in a way that makes her curious about You — that draws her into a relationship, not religion. Let my love for You overflow into the way I love her, and give me grace when I fail. And when I get too protective, too indulgent, or too afraid — pull me back to You, where she’s safest.</p>

<p>Give me wisdom, Father, in guiding her friendships. Surround her with girls and women who speak truth, walk in integrity, and call her higher. Keep her from those who would manipulate, use, gossip, or lead her into darkness. Let her desire deep friendships that reflect Jesus — friendships that stir up bold faith and remind her who she really is.</p>

<p>And Father, give her discernment and strength to walk away from the distractions and traps of this world — vanity, social media pressure, comparison, insecurity, and anything that would make her question her worth. Help me give her the tools to resist what is harmful and pursue what is holy. And when she’s tempted to pick up stupid, give her the clarity and confidence to walk away — because she knows who she is and whose she is.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a happy life for her, but a life filled with purpose where she desires what we desire, a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. I want her to be a woman of truth, compassion, strength, and radiant joy. Let her shine in the darkness. Let her laugh without fear of the future. Let her become the daughter, the woman, the warrior, and the worshiper You’ve designed her to be. And help me love her well every step of the way — as a parent, a protector, a guide, and a servant of the most High King who called her by name.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
