<h2>A Prayer for a Sick Loved One</h2>

<p>Father, I lift up someone I love who is sick. You already know their name, their condition, their symptoms, their pain — all of it. You know the scans, the bloodwork, the prognosis, the questions, the fears. You see what the doctors can’t see. You feel what they’re too tired to say. You hear every groan, every prayer, every whispered “help me.” And I know You care more deeply than I ever could.</p>

<p>So I come to You, Jehovah Rapha — the God who heals. I’m asking for Your healing touch. For Your mercy. For Your power to move in their body. Whether it’s a cold or cancer, emotional trauma or chronic pain, depression or disease — none of it is too big for You. And none of it is too small to matter. I’m asking You to stretch out Your healing hand and do what no medication, no treatment, no therapy can do. Heal them. Restore them. Strengthen them — body, mind, and spirit.</p>

<p>But Father, I’m also asking for more than healing — I’m asking for hope. For comfort in the waiting. For peace in the unknown. For courage to keep going. Surround them with support, with people who speak truth and life and not fear. Protect their heart from despair. And protect mine too, Lord. It’s hard to watch someone I love suffer. It’s hard not to feel helpless. But I choose to trust You — even when I don’t understand.</p>

<p>Use this time to draw them closer to You. Let them feel Your nearness in ways they never have before. Speak gently in the quiet. Show them You are with them — in the waiting room, in the hospital bed, in the sleepless nights, in the prayers they’re too tired to pray. And if You choose to heal through medicine, thank You. If You choose to heal miraculously, thank You. And if healing looks different than what I imagined — help me still say thank You, because You are good either way.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just relief, but resurrection. A stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — for them, and for me. Whether this is a season or a story, use every moment to reveal more of who You are. Be their healer. Be their peace. Be their hope. And help me keep bringing them to You — again and again, until healing comes, or until Heaven welcomes them home.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
