<h2>A Prayer of Gratitude for Healing and Restoration</h2>

<p>God, thank You. Thank You for being my Healer — the One who sees the wounds I hide and brings restoration where I thought there was no hope. You didn’t leave me in my brokenness. You met me there. You held me there. And slowly, gently, You’ve begun to restore what was shattered inside me.</p>

<p>I praise You for the healing You’ve already done — for the pain You’ve lifted, the lies You’ve silenced, and the strength You’ve renewed. Thank You for walking with me through the hard days, for never rushing the process, for showing me that healing is holy and restoration is real. You’ve been kind. You’ve been patient. You’ve been near.</p>

<p>Even when I doubted, You stayed. Even when I struggled to believe anything could change, You never stopped working beneath the surface. Thank You for the little victories, the slow mending, the quiet ways You whispered, “You’re not done. I’m not done.” Thank You for being faithful — even when I wasn’t sure I had any faith left.</p>

<p>Thank You for restoring not just my peace, but my hope. Not just my strength, but my joy. You didn’t just patch me up — You are making me new. And for that, I will praise You again and again. Help me never forget what You’ve done. Let me carry this healing as a testimony of Your goodness, and let it become fuel for my gratitude every single day.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just to be made whole, but to walk in a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where gratitude overflows from a healed heart. One where my restoration becomes a reason to worship You more.</p>

<p>Thank You, God, for being the One who heals and the One who restores. I will never stop thanking You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
