<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Empty</h2>

<p>Father, I feel hollow. Like I’m moving through life, going through the motions, showing up… but inside, I’m just not there. I don’t feel joy. I don’t feel connection. I don’t feel much of anything. I know You’re still good. I know You’re still with me. But right now, I feel empty — like something’s missing, and I don’t even know what it is. Passion? Desire? Hope? Mercy? Grace? Love? Joy?</p>

<p>Lord, I’m not ashamed to admit it anymore. I’ve tried to fill the emptiness with things that never satisfied — distractions, achievements, people, busyness, even sin. I’ve chased temporary fixes when what I needed was eternal presence. I’ve eaten the bread of anxiety instead of feeding on Your Word. I’ve drunk from broken cisterns instead of drinking deeply from the well of Living Water. Forgive me. I need You, not just to fill me, but to heal me — to restore what’s been drained, what is broken, to revive what’s been dulled, to replenish what’s been poured out.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, breathe life into my soul again. Wake up the places that have gone numb. Fill every empty space with truth, with love, with peace, with You. Strip away the lies that say I have to be full before I come to You. You are the fullness I need. You are the answer to the ache. You don’t despise my emptiness — You meet me in it. You draw near to it. And You are faithful to fill what is yielded.</p>

<p>Help me stop striving. Help me stop performing. Help me rest in the truth that I don’t need to earn Your presence, I don't need to earn Your favor, I don't need to earn Your love — I just need to make room for it. So I clear the clutter. I make space. I open my hands, my heart, my soul — and I ask You to pour Yourself into me. Not just a drop. Not just enough to get by. But an overflow. Fill me with with an outpouring. An encounter. A fresh filling that reminds me that I am Yours and that You never run dry. I know I'm a small vessel, but I can overflow, overflow me with You and help me to give that overflow to others. </p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a temporary fix for the emptiness, but a permanent filling. Not just to feel better, but to be whole. I long for a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one where You are my source, my joy, my purpose, my strength, and my satisfaction. Fill me again, Lord. Fill me until I overflow — with Your presence, Your peace, and Your power.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
