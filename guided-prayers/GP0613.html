<h2>A Prayer for My World</h2>

<p>Father, I bring You my world — the people I love, the responsibilities I carry, the pressures I face, the distractions I battle, and the blessings I often forget to thank You for. You see it all. You see the details no one else does — the weight of my thoughts, the condition of my heart, the choices I wrestle with, and the daily rhythm that either draws me closer to You or slowly pulls me away. I don’t want to drift. I want to live fully aware of You, right here in the middle of my world.</p>

<p>Cover my home with Your presence. Fill it with peace, laughter, love, and grace. Strengthen my marriage. Draw us closer together and closer to You. Give us the wisdom to protect what matters and let go of what doesn’t. Help us parent with patience, truth, and tenderness. Let our children see You through us — not perfection, but presence, not religion, but relationship. Be at the center of our home, and in the details of every decision we make.</p>

<p>Father, bless my work. Let it be fruitful and fulfilling. Help me to work with integrity and excellence, and never let it become my identity. Keep me from striving in my own strength. Teach me to rest, to trust, and to follow where You lead. In the busy and the still, the success and the struggle — help me keep You first.</p>

<p>And Lord, guard my heart from the distractions and subtle temptations that try to steal my time, my peace, and my devotion to You. Social media, comparison, pride, performance, self-pity, passivity — I lay them all down. If there is any demonic influence creeping into my home, my thoughts, my relationships, or my habits — in Jesus’ name, bind it, cast it out, and fill those spaces with truth, light, and life. I claim my world for You.</p>

<p>Help me to love well. Help me to listen better. Help me to be more present with the people You’ve placed in my life — not distracted by screens or schedules, but grounded in love, truth, and grace. Let my friends feel encouraged, my coworkers see integrity, my family feel safe, and my enemies see mercy. Let my life reflect You in every space I occupy. Help me to live for You and be more like Jesus, loving, caring and kind.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a comfortable life, but a consecrated one. A stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You in the middle of my world — not around it, not outside of it, but *within* it. Make my world a place where You are welcomed, worshiped, honored, and loved. And let it begin with me, every morning, every moment, every choice, every breath.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
