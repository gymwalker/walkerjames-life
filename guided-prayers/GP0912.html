<h2>A Prayer to Break Soul Ties and Unholy Agreements</h2>

<p>Most Gracious Heavenly Father, I come before You in the name of Jesus — the name that heals, restores, delivers, and sets captives free. Today, I bring before You every place where my soul has been tied to someone, something, or some moment that You never intended for me. Every relationship, memory, sin, agreement, secret, or emotional bond that has wrapped itself around my heart, my mind, or my body — I bring it into the light of Your love and forgiveness, and I surrender it to You.</p>

<p>In the name of Jesus, I renounce every unholy soul tie — emotional, sexual, mental, or spiritual. I break every tie formed through sin, trauma, codependency, manipulation, fear, addiction, or rebellion. I declare that I am not owned by my past. I am not bound by old desires. I am not controlled by past relationships. I am a Child of the Living God, I belong to Jesus — fully, completely, eternally.</p>

<p>I sever the ties of shame, guilt, regret, and unworthiness.  
I sever the ties of comparison, jealousy, and emotional confusion.  
I sever the ties to sexual sin, secrecy, fantasy, pornograpy, and unhealthy desire.  
I sever the ties to control, intimidation, people-pleasing, and false responsibility.  
I sever the ties to vows I made in fear — and to words spoken over me in anger or pain.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, I cancel every unholy agreement I’ve made — knowingly or unknowingly. Every time I said “I’ll never trust again”… “I’ll always be this way”… “I deserve this”… or “This is just who I am” — I break those lies and the legal permission they gave the enemy to hold me captive and to tresspass on property that You own Lord Jesus. I renounce every false identity, every label that didn’t come from You, every belief that kept me small, stuck, or silent. I tear down every altar I built to past pain — and I build a new one to honor You, my Lord, my Master and my King Jesus.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, come now and fill every place that’s been emptied. Where a tie has been broken, form a bond with truth. Where an agreement has been shattered, write a new one in grace. Where an identity has been removed, reveal the name You’ve given me since the beginning. Restore what was stolen. Reclaim what was surrendered. And root me deeply in the love of Jesus — the only love that never entangles, never manipulates, never controls, and never fails.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a soul that’s clean, a heart that’s whole, and a life that’s free. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one where no shadow of the past stands between us, and no tie pulls me in the wrong direction again. You are enough. You are all I need. I am all Yours.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ powerful and restoring name, Amen.</p>
