<h2>A Prayer for Someone Who’s Far from God</h2>

<p>Father, I bring someone before You right now who feels so far from You. Maybe they once walked closely, but now they’ve drifted — or maybe they’ve never really known You at all. Either way, You see them. You know the distance in their heart, the doubts they carry, the lies they’ve believed, and the wounds that may be holding them back. And yet, You haven’t let them go. Not for a moment.</p>

<p>You are the Good Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine to chase after the one — and I’m asking You now, please go after them. Interrupt the silence. Break through the noise. Speak in a way only they will recognize. Use whatever You must — a memory, a scripture, a conversation, a moment of stillness — to draw them back to You. Let them feel the weight of Your love pressing in on every side, even if they’re doing everything they can to run away.</p>

<p>Help me, Lord, to love them well. Not to push or preach or pressure, but to reflect You — patiently, gently, persistently. Let my life stir something in them. Let my prayers plant seeds that only You can grow. And help me not to give up when it feels like nothing is changing. You never gave up on me… and I won’t give up on them.</p>

<p>Protect them from the traps of the enemy — from apathy, from shame, from pride, from distraction, from counterfeit comfort that numbs instead of heals. Don’t let them settle for less than the fullness of who You are. Bring the right people into their life. Cut through the noise. And bring them home — not to religion, not to routine, but to relationship. To You.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just their return, but their transformation, and like mine, their desire for a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Help them to invest in their relationship with You, to be a mighty person after Your own heart. To truly love and adore You! I want them to experience Your presence like never before — to know what it means to be fully known and fully loved. To walk in freedom, purpose, and truth. Bring the right voices, the right convictions, the right truths, and the right encounters to call them back. And while You’re working on them… keep working on me, too.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
