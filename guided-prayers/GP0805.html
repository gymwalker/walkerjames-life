<h2>A Prayer to Simply Be Still</h2>

<p>Father, I’ve been running — not always physically, but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. My mind races with thoughts I can’t control. My heart spins with worries I can’t fix. I feel like I have to keep doing, keep performing, keep holding it all together. But right now… I just need to stop. I need to exhale. I need to be still. And I need You to meet me here in this stillness.</p>

<p>You said, “Be still, and know that I am God.” Not “do more.” Not “figure it out.” Just be still. So here I am — no agenda, no fancy words, no performance. Just me. Sitting in silence. Resting in who You are. Letting my soul catch up with the truth my heart forgets: that You are God. That You are good. That You are enough. And I don’t have to carry the world — because You already do.</p>

<p>Father, quiet the chaos inside of me. Still the storm in my mind. Ease the tension in my shoulders. Slow the beat of my anxious heart. Teach me how to breathe again — not shallow, not rushed, but deeply… as someone fully known and fully loved. Let Your presence fill the space where my stress has lived. Let Your peace invade every restless corner. Let Your whisper be louder than the world’s noise.</p>

<p>I don’t want to rush past You. I don’t want to miss You in my striving. I don’t want to outrun the grace You’ve already poured over me. So I surrender this moment. I open my hands. I open my heart. And I ask You to simply sit with me. No expectations. No pressure. Just love. Just presence. Just You and me — together in the quiet.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just rest from activity, but rest for my soul. Not just a pause in my schedule, but peace in my spirit. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that isn’t built on what I do, but on who You are. I don’t need to say much. I don’t need to do much. I just need You. Right here. Right now. Because You are enough.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
