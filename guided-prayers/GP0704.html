<h2>A Prayer to Let Go of the Past</h2>

<p>Father, I want to move forward — but part of me is still stuck. Stuck in what happened. Stuck in what I did. Stuck in what You didn’t do — or at least what I *thought* You should’ve done. I’ve carried pain, regret, disappointment, and failure like luggage I can’t seem to drop. And the past? It follows me. Sometimes it whispers. Sometimes it shouts. But always, it tries to define me. And I’m tired. I want to be free from it and of it.</p>

<p>I confess that I've believed the lie that what Jesus did on the cross wasn’t enough for me. That somehow, my sin was worse, my shame was heavier, my consequences more deserving of punishment than what Jesus already endured. I see now how wrong that was. How dishonoring to the One who gave everything to set me free. Forgive me for believing I needed to *add to* the suffering of Jesus by punishing myself. Forgive me for refusing to fully receive Your forgiveness. That was pride. That was unbelief. That was a lie straight from the pit of hell — and I reject it now in Jesus’ name.</p>

<p>You said the cross was enough. You said, “It is finished.” You paid it all. You paid it in full. My past, my present, my future — it’s all covered by the blood of Jesus. And from this moment forward, I choose to receive it. Fully. Freely. Finally. No more shame. No more penance. Just grace. Your beautiful grace and love.</p>

<p>And Father, I confess something else — I haven’t always trusted You. I said I did. I wanted to. But after all the loss, the rejection, the disappointment, the unanswered prayers, I pulled away. Many times I have stood at a crossroads — and instead of "trusting" you, I threw a temper tantrum, instead. I picked up stupid and ran with it. I know, not the wisest thing to do. And even now, trust doesn’t come easy. But I see it clearly now: **I can’t truly love You if I don’t trust You.** Not trusting You is the foundation of every distance I’ve ever felt. Forgive me for making You pay for my pain. I repent for holding You hostage to my unmet expectations.</p>

<p>Help me rebuild my trust in You — not based on how life goes, but based on who You are. Teach me that trust is a choice. A daily choice. That it isn’t earned — it’s surrendered. That it’s the foundation of intimacy, and I can’t have the relationship I want with You without it.</p>

<p>So today, I choose to let go of the past — not just the sin and the shame, but the mistrust, the bitterness, the disappointment, the offense I held against You. I lay it all down. I don’t want it anymore. It may explain part of my story, but it doesn’t get to define the rest of it.</p>

<p>Heal me, Father. Redeem what was broken. Restore what was stolen. Teach me how to forgive — others, myself, and You. Help me stop letting the past write the future. Let this be the moment I stop looking back… and start running forward.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just relief, but restoration. Not just peace, but deep transformation. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — the kind that trusts completely, loves unconditionally, and walks boldly in freedom. Thank You for not giving up on me. Thank You for being enough. You always were. You always will be. You always are.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
