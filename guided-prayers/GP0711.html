<h2>A Prayer of Resignation</h2>

<p>Father, I have a confession to make — one I’m not proud of. Somewhere along the way, I started acting like I was in charge. Like I had to be the provider, the protector, the planner, the fixer, the savior. I tried to hold it all together. I tried to carry the weight of the world — my world — on shoulders that weren’t built for it. I tried to be god… and I failed. Miserably.</p>

<p>So today, Lord, I’m turning in my resignation. I quit trying to be You. I’m done pretending I know it all, can handle it all, can fix it all, can control it all. That job was never mine to begin with. It belongs to You — and You alone. I’m not wise enough, strong enough, good enough, or loving enough to be God. But You are. And I trust You to take back what was never mine in the first place.</p>

<p>I surrender my plans. I surrender my timelines. I surrender my need to have all the answers. I surrender the illusion of control. I lay down the heavy crown I’ve been trying to wear and place it at Your feet — where it’s always belonged. You reign. Not me. You are Lord. Not me. You are God. And I’m just grateful to be Yours.</p>

<p>Forgive me for the times I made You too small and myself too big. Forgive me for trying to manage outcomes You never asked me to manage. Forgive me for trusting in my own wisdom more than I trusted in Your heart. I see it now — my role is not to rule, but to rest. Not to direct, but to depend. Not to command, but to commune. I step down. And I bow down. And I give You back Your rightful place in my life, in my heart, in my mind, and in my future.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just relief from pressure, but the freedom that comes from surrender. Not just peace of mind, but peace of heart. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one where I stop trying to be You… and start simply trusting You. Living for You. Being more like Jesus, more loving, more caring, more kind. Because You’re enough. Always have been. Always will be.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
