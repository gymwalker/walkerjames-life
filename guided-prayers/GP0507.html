<h2>A Prayer of Praise for God’s Faithfulness</h2>

<p>God, You have been faithful — not just once or twice, but over and over again. Through every season, every battle, every valley, every victory — You’ve been there. You’ve kept Your Word. You’ve kept Your promises. And You’ve kept me. Even when I wandered, even when I doubted, even when I was unfaithful — You stayed. You were faithful.</p>

<p>You’ve never left. You’ve never given up. You’ve never walked away. You’ve never changed Your mind about me. You’ve been the anchor in every storm, the steady hand when I felt shaken, the voice of truth when the lies got loud. Your track record is perfect — even when mine is not.</p>

<p>I praise You for the faithfulness I can see — the answered prayers, the unexpected provision, the strength You gave when I had none. And I praise You for the faithfulness I couldn’t see at the time — the doors You closed to protect me, the delays that were actually preparation, the “no’s” that led to something better. You are faithful in every detail, every moment, every chapter.</p>

<p>God, help me remember what You’ve done. Help me to look back and see the evidence of Your hand in my life. Help me to tell the stories — not just of success, but of Your steadfastness in the struggle. Help me to praise You for who You are, not just for what You do. Let faith rise in me when I remember Your faithfulness. Let my trust deepen when I recall how many times You’ve come through.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just short-term relief, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I walk in daily remembrance of Your faithfulness. One where gratitude anchors my soul and fuels my obedience. One where Your consistency becomes my confidence, no matter what lies ahead.</p>

<p>Thank You for never changing. Thank You for never failing. Thank You for being the same faithful God yesterday, today, and forever.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
