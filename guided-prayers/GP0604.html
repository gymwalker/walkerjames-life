<h2>A Prayer for My Wife</h2>

<p>Father, thank You for the incredible gift of my wife, what a precious and valuable treasure she is to me. Thank You for her heart, her strength, her tenderness, her resilience, and the beauty she carries — inside and out. You see her in ways I never could. You know every thought, every fear, every hope she carries deep in her soul. You understand the burdens she hides, the pressure she feels, and the longing in her spirit to be seen, known, cherished, and safe. And You love her perfectly in every place I fall short.</p>

<p>I lift her up to You now — completely. I pray You would renew her strength, quiet her anxieties, and flood her with Your Shalom peace, that perfect peace that goes beyond understanding. Remind her that she is never alone. That she is loved not because of what she does, but because of who she is — Your daughter. Your beloved. Your masterpiece. When she’s weary, hold her. When she’s overwhelmed, calm her. When she questions her worth, speak truth louder than the lies.</p>

<p>Help ME Father, to be the man that You need me to be for her, help me to be the MAN she needs me to be for her — to always always always love her, protect her, defend her, pray for her, provide mightily for her, and keep her from any and all harm, lies, untruth, evil, or malice our enemy may want to bring against her. And help her to cooperate with that love and protection and provision. Don’t let anyone or anything — or any dreams or any demonic influence — interfere with our relationship with each other and our relationship with You. Help us to keep You in the center of our relationship with each other.</p>

<p>Help me love her well. Help me show her not just with my words but by my actions that she is valued, treasured, respected, honored, loved, desired, wanted, needed, and adored. Teach me to listen with intention, to lead with gentleness, and to fight for her heart, not just for her attention. Help me speak life when I’m tempted to criticize, to pray for her when I’m tempted to withdraw, and to serve her with joy, not obligation. Let her feel safe with me — emotionally, spiritually, and physically — and help me create space where she can flourish and be fully herself.</p>

<p>And Father, help me to guard our marriage fiercely — not just from outside threats, but from anything in me that would poison what You’ve joined together. Keep me from falling into sin — whether it’s pornography, acohol or drug addictions, pride, gambling, anger, or anything else that would distort how I see her or how I love her. Let me never treat her like an object for my own pleasure, but as a daughter of the King — holy, precious, and worthy of honor. Help me love her with purity and integrity, and give me the courage to turn from anything that threatens to create distance between me and You, or me and her. Let me value our marriage so much that I refuse to let poison live in it — not even in secret.</p>

<p>Surround her with godly women who lift her up. Fill her life with Your truth through books, sermons, friendships, and moments that remind her she is seen and chosen by You. Draw her closer to Your heart every day, and give her everything she needs to walk confidently in the purpose You created her for.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just peace in our home, but a wife who is thriving in a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. I want her joy to be rooted in Your presence. I want her confidence to come from who she is in You. Bring whatever she needs — the right voices, the right truth, the right support — and help me to never stop praying for her, pursuing her, and pointing her to You, her first and forever love.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
