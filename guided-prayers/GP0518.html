<h2>A Prayer of Praise for God’s Grace</h2>

<p>God, where would I be without You, without Your grace? Undeserved, unearned, unrepayable — and yet You give it freely. Again and again. Your grace meets me in my mess. It covers my sin. It carries me when I can’t carry myself. And it never runs out. Never weakens. Never fails. Never lets me down. You are the God of grace — and I praise You for that.</p>

<p>Thank You for grace that saves, but also for grace that sustains. Grace that forgives, but also grace that transforms. You don’t just wipe away the past — You rewrite my future. You take broken pieces and make something beautiful. You take shame and replace it with peace. You take my failures and redeem them for Your glory. Your grace isn’t just a second chance… it’s new life, new identity, new purpose.</p>

<p>I praise You for the grace that found me when I wasn’t looking. For the grace that kept me when I wanted to give up. For the grace that calls me by name and invites me closer — not because I’m worthy, but because You are good. You don’t treat me like I deserve. You treat me like I belong. And You paid the highest price to make sure I could.</p>

<p>Help me live in awe of Your grace every day. Help me to never grow numb to the cost of it — the cross, the blood, the sacrifice of Jesus. Help me to extend the same grace to others that You so freely give to me. Let Your grace shape the way I think, speak, forgive, and live. Let it be the melody of my heart, the reason I worship, the story I tell again and again.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just knowledge of grace, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where your love and grace is the foundation of everything. One where I stop striving and start abiding. One where Your kindness leads me to repentance and Your mercy leads me home to You.</p>

<p>Thank You, God, for amazing grace — the kind that saves, sustains, and changes everything.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
