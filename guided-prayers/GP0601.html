<h2>A Prayer for a Friend Who’s Hurting</h2>

<p>God, I lift up my friend to You right now. You see their pain more clearly than I ever could. You know the weight they’re carrying, the battles they’re fighting, and the tears they’ve cried in secret. You know the questions they don’t have answers to… and the prayers they’ve stopped praying because they don’t know if You’re still listening. But I know You are. And I know You care. And I know You love them dearly.</p>

<p>Please meet them in the middle of their pain. Wrap them in Your comfort. Let them feel Your presence, that You close — not because they deserve it, but because You have promised to be faithful and near to the brokenhearted. Pour peace into their chaos. Speak hope into their heaviness. And where they’ve lost strength, be the strength that carries them forward. Give them Your peace that passes ALL understanding.</p>

<p>If there’s a way You want to use me — to speak life, to listen well, to simply be present — show me how. I don’t want to offer empty words or quick fixes, or useless platitudes. I want to reflect You. Help me to be Jesus with skin on. Give me compassion, empathy, patience, and grace to walk with them through this valley. Help me trust that You’re working, even when I can’t see how.</p>

<p>Lord, I also ask You to bring the right people at the right time — friends who won’t just say the easy things, but who will gently speak truth and love into their life. Bring the right verses, sermons, books, or songs that whisper Your goodness and steady their heart. Lead them in ways only You can, and keep me anchored in prayer until healing comes. Help us to praise and worship You in this storm.</p>

<p><strong>I want what You want… for them, for me, for this moment, a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. I want healing that goes deeper than the surface. I want peace that lasts. I want their heart to know You more intimately because of this season — not in spite of it. Grow our faith while we wait. Teach us how to pray with endurance. And let us always believe that You are good, even here, even now, even in this storm.</strong></p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
