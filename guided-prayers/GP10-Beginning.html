  <li>Abba Father, I accept Your invitation into perfect union — Father, Son, and Spirit. Let my life reflect the love and oneness You share with each other. I want nothing less than to dwell in the center of that holy intimacy every moment of every day.</li>
  <li>Father God, unite with me today. Surround me, fill me, and flow through me. Let my thoughts, my choices, and my worship be a living reflection of Your Spirit, Your love, and Your truth alive in me.</li>
  <li>Holy Spirit, consume every part of me. Take all of me. Possess all of me. Empower me to live a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ—completely led and empowered by You.</li>
  <li>Father, Help me invest deeply in my relationship with You. Let seeking, knowing, and walking with You be my highest priority and greatest pursuit every day.</li>
  <li>Holy Spirit, overflow me with You, with Your love, Your presence, and Your heart for others. Let my life be marked by Your influence—guiding my words and shaping my actions to reflect Jesus.</li>
  <li>Father, lead me away from fear, distraction, and lesser desires. Fix my focus on You and Your Kingdom — not the temporary, but the eternal. Guide me by Your Spirit, with clarity and peace, into all that You have for me today.</li>
  <li>Father, fill me with wisdom, insight, discernment, discipline, and Your shalom peace in everything I do for You and with You. Let my actions be shaped by Your Spirit, not my flesh.</li>
  <li>Father, awaken every spiritual sense within me. Open my eyes to eternal things. Give me supernatural perception so I may see, know, and respond to what truly matters to You.</li>
  <li>Father, let me taste, see, and know that You are good. Make Your presence and Your Kingdom more real to me than anything this world could ever offer.</li>
  <li>Father, I’m overwhelmed by Your mercy, Your grace. My only worthy response is praise and worship of who You are. Thank You for choosing me, adopting me, redeeming me, and revealing the beauty of Your gospel, to me.</li>
  <li>Thank You, Jesus, for giving me Your power, Your strength, and Your authority to affect this world for Your Kingdom and Your Glory. Let me live today fully aligned with You, walking in Your presence and depending on Your Spirit.</li>
  <li>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit — I long for Your return, for the day You rule and reign over all. May Your Kingdom come quickly. Let my heart be found ready, watching, and full of faith, joy, and excitement for Your return.</li>
