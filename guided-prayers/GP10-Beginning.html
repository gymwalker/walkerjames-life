  <p><strong>Abba Father,</strong> as I come to You today, I invite You — Father God, Lord Jesus Christ, precious Holy Spirit — to unite with me as I desire union with You. Unite me with You. Let me hear and see Your lovingkindness always, for I trust in You.</p>

  <p>Always, always, always encourage me to want and desire You more than I want Your stuff. Shine Your light on my path. Teach me the way in which I should walk. Guide and direct every step I take, for I lift up my soul to You.</p>

  <p>Father, show me what more You have for me. Let me never be without Your light, Jesus. I do not want to be led by fear, worry, or doubt today. I do not want to be distracted by the things of this world. I want to be led by You and Your Spirit. Let my focus be on You and Your Kingdom — not on what is temporary, but on what is eternal — the work You have for me to do today.</p>

  <p><strong>Show me the way You want me to take. Show me all that You have for me.</strong></p>

  <p>Help me to love, adore, and greatly respect You. Help me be grateful for all You do, to praise and worship You all day long. May Your Spirit lead me in the way I should go with Your tremendous favor and blessing — which is how I will know it’s You.</p>

  <p>Thank You, Father, for the power and authority You have given me to pray this way today. Thank You for always listening to and hearing my prayers. Help me to always listen to and hear You. Remind me that my prayers to You are relational, not mechanical.</p>

  <p><strong>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit,</strong> I look forward with great hope and anticipation to Your coming — Your return, Your Kingdom being established in full, where You rule and reign over all mankind. May Your Kingdom come. Help me to partner with You, cooperate with You, and participate in what You are doing in Your Kingdom. Give me purpose — help me to know and do what You created me for, in service to You and Your Kingdom.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank You, Father,</strong> for bringing me here today. Thank You for delighting in me. Thank You for wanting to spend time with me — for desiring this time together.</p>

  <p>Through the perfect sacrifice of Your Son Jesus, You have made me strong, powerful, and mighty — giving me the authority to ask You to bring Your Kingdom here on earth and to intervene mightily in my life. Thank You that the weapons You’ve given me are divinely powerful for the destruction of enemy strongholds and fortresses. Empower me to use them wisely.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank You, Jesus,</strong> for giving me Your strength, Your power, and Your authority to effect this world for Your Kingdom and Your Glory. Let Your Kingdom come and invade every part of my life. Help me to stay close to You — to live and love in Your presence and in Your strength today.</p>

  <p><strong>Father, protect me</strong> from putting my will or my desires before Yours. Help me surrender everything to You. May Your will — always, always, always — be done in my life. Strengthen my passion and desire to live out Your will, not mine.</p>

  <p>Father, what do You want me to do today? How can I serve You and Your Kingdom today? How can I partner with You in what You’re doing around me? How can I glorify You with my time, my words, and my life?</p>

  <p><strong>Father, I’m overwhelmed</strong> by Your grace. My only adequate response is endless praise and worship of who You are. Thank You for choosing me, for adopting me, for redeeming me, for forgiving me, and for revealing the mystery of the gospel and Your love. Help me to shine Your light and love into others’ lives today.</p>

  <p>Thank You for answering my prayers. Thank You for giving me the words to pray. Thank You for delighting in me and choosing to spend time with me.</p>

  <p><strong>Quicken to life</strong> every spiritual power within me. Help me lay hold of eternal things. Open my spiritual eyes to see. Give me acute spiritual perception. Enable me to taste of You and know that You are good. Make You and Your Kingdom more real to me than anything else in this world.</p>

  <p>Lord, please guard every word I say, write, and think so that I reflect You and Your love. Help me speak words of healing, not harm. Words of love, not hate. Words of grace, not cruelty or spite. Let my tongue glorify You.</p>

  <p><strong>Father, grant me wisdom</strong>, prudence, insight, understanding, knowledge, discretion, strength, discipline, discernment, diligence, and Your perfect shalom peace in everything I do. Let every effort I make deepen my relationship with You.</p>

  <p>Bring my flesh under Your control and in obedience to You. Prevent it from being manipulated or controlled by the enemy. Keep me from prideful, arrogant, lustful thoughts. Help my mind and flesh align with Your Spirit and Your Word. Help me obey Your commands with joy, trust and surrender.</p>

  <p><strong>Holy Spirit, overflow within me.</strong> Let Your love, Your care, and Your concern for others mark my life. May my words and actions reflect You and give others encouragement to know Jesus — to desire a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ, empowered by You.</p>

  <p>Holy Spirit, consume all of me. Take all of me. Possess all of me.</p>
