<h2>A Prayer of Gratitude for God’s Unfailing Love</h2>

<p>God, thank You for loving me — not just once, not just when I deserved it, but always. Your love has never failed. Not in my darkest moments, not in my stubbornness, not in my wandering. Through every mistake, every fear, every disappointment, every doubt, every question, You have remained steady. Your love has been my anchor, my covering, my comfort, and my hope.</p>

<p>I praise You for a love that isn’t based on my performance. You don’t love me more when I succeed or less when I struggle. You love me because it’s who You are, it's what You've chosen to do. You are love — constant, eternal, unshakable love. And that love has chased me down, lifted me up, and held me together when everything else was falling apart. I didn’t earn it. I don’t deserve it. But You gave it freely, and I receive it with a grateful heart.</p>

<p>Thank You for showing me what real love looks like — sacrificial, patient, kind, forgiving, and full of truth. Thank You for loving me through Jesus — for the cross, for the blood, for the resurrection, for the invitation to be Yours. Thank You for the way Your love changes me — how it softens what’s hard in me, heals what’s broken in me, and calls out what’s true in me.</p>

<p>Help me live in response to that love. Help me love others the way You’ve loved me — not because they deserve it, but because You are in me. Help me extend grace, speak truth with kindness, and forgive even when it’s hard. Let my life be evidence of Your love — a light that points back to You in every word, every act, every moment of compassion and care.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a passing awareness of Your love, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where Your unfailing love becomes my identity. One where I walk in it, live from it, and share it with the world around me.</p>

<p>Thank You for never giving up on me. Thank You for staying. Thank You for loving me fully, faithfully, and forever.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
