<h2>A Prayer for a New Chapter in Family or Marriage</h2>

<p>Father, I bring my family — or my marriage — to You. You already know the story. The struggles, the silence, the tension, the things we don’t talk about, the words we wish we could take back. You know where it’s been hard, where we’ve fallen short, where we’ve stopped trying, and where we’ve quietly lost hope. But You’re the God of new beginnings — and I’m asking You to write a new chapter for us, one only You can write.</p>

<p>Forgive us, Lord — for the ways we’ve hurt each other, neglected each other, misunderstood each other. Forgive the patterns we’ve allowed, the walls we’ve built, and the distance we’ve normalized. Tear down everything that doesn’t honor You. Root out the bitterness, the resentment, the selfishness, the pride. Help us confess what needs to be confessed. Help us listen when it’s hard. And help us forgive as freely as You have forgiven us.</p>

<p>Lord, breathe life where things have grown cold. Bring joy where there’s been heaviness. Bring laughter back into our home. Bring kindness back into our conversations. Heal the wounds we can’t heal ourselves — the betrayals, the regrets, the breakdowns in trust. Show us how to rebuild — not by going back to the way things were, but by stepping forward into something better. Something deeper. Something led by You.</p>

<p>Help us prioritize what matters most. Help us be present with one another. Help us choose connection over distraction, love over frustration, unity over isolation. Give us a fresh vision for who we are as a family or as a couple — not just surviving together, but thriving together, growing together, becoming more like Jesus together. More loving, more caring, more kind.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just peace, but purpose. Not just repair, but renewal. Not just another chapter — but a sacred one. I want all of us to want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You… and with the people You’ve given us to love. Make us a reflection of Your grace. Let our story give You glory. And let this be the beginning of something new, something holy, something worth fighting for.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
