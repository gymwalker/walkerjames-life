<h2>A Prayer for the World</h2>

<p>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit — I lift up this world to You. A world You created, a world You love, and a world that desperately needs You. A world that, from the beginning, chose "independence" from You rather than "dependence" on You. You see the chaos that has ensued from that choice — the wars, the division, the hatred, the deception, the idolatry, the injustice, the sin, and the oppression. But You also see the remnant. The faithful. The hungry. The hopeful. The presently redeemed, and You see what can still be redeemed. So I pray boldly for the world — not because it deserves it, but because You died for it.</p>

<p>Lord Jesus, bind the global forces of darkness — devils, demons, principalities, and powers in high places. Shut down the spiritual strongholds that are fueling hatred, violence, genocide, corruption, abuse, human trafficking, and false religion. Expose and dismantle every agenda that exalts itself against the knowledge of You, oh Lord. Where evil has been given permission — in governments, institutions, and even churches — revoke it now in Your name. Paralyze darkness with the fear and terror of You, King Jesus. Let no demonic power stand unopposed. Send Your angel armies to war in the heavenlies and let truth prevail on earth.</p>

<p>Bring peace, Lord, where there is war. Bring justice where there is tyranny. Bring hope where there is despair. Bring repentance where there is arrogance. Pour out Your Spirit on every nation, every people group, every tribe and tongue. Let the name of Jesus be lifted up in the places where it’s illegal to speak it. Let revival break out in unexpected places. Let the gospel run freely where governments have tried to cage it. Let light burst through where the darkness has ruled for too long.</p>

<p>Lord, You’ve seen it all — and let’s be honest, we’ve made a mess of it. We’re terrible at ruling ourselves. Our sin, our pride, our greed, our thirst for power — it all gets in the way of justice, truth, and love. We’ve proven over and over that we can’t fix this world on our own. We don’t need more human solutions — we need **You**. We need Your Kingdom to come, we need Your will to be done. We need Jesus to reign. We need Your righteous way of loving, leading, protecting, and restoring. We’re tired of corruption. Tired of deception. Tired of lies. Tired of evil appearing to win all the time. So we say it loud: let Your Kingdom come, and let Your will be done — here, now, just like it is in heaven.</p>

<p>Raise up global leaders who honor You — not just with words, but with their lives. Replace the corrupt with the humble. The violent with the peace-makers. The self-serving with the selfless. Let the wisdom of heaven invade the halls of power. And for those already in leadership, surround them with voices of truth. Silence the voices of evil. Break the influence of bribes, blackmail, and control. Heal relationships between nations. Raise up intercessors, missionaries, reformers, and ambassadors of Your Kingdom who carry love, truth, and courage into the world’s hardest places.</p>

<p>And Father, break the power of religions that spread hate, violence, control, fear, or oppression. Tear down every spiritual stronghold that denies Jesus as Lord. Let the gospel shine through every crack of resistance. Appear to the lost in dreams, visions, and divine encounters. Send laborers into the harvest fields and give them supernatural courage. Let every knee bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord — not through coercion, but through conviction, encounter, and love.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just temporary peace, but eternal transformation. I desire to see a world that desires a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Let the world know You. Let the world honor You. Let the world be saved. And if there’s any part You’ve called me to play in that story — show me, and give me the faith to say yes. I am available, my Lord, my Master, my King, my Savior, my Friend.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
