<h2>A Prayer for a Weary Soul</h2>

<p>Father, I’m tired. Not just physically — though some days even getting out of bed feels like a battle — but deep down in my soul. I’m weary. Worn thin. It feels like I’ve been carrying too much for too long, and I’m not sure how much longer I can keep holding on. I don’t want to give up, but if I’m honest… I’m close. I need Your strength. I need Your rest. I need You to carry what I no longer can. Actually, that is not the whole truth, I am so weary, I just need you to carry me.</p>

<p>Lord, You see everything. The battles no one else sees. The burdens I can’t share out loud. The private grief. The delayed dreams. The spiritual attacks that come wave after wave, trying to wear me down, wear me out, and silence my hope. Silence the mission and purpose You have given me. But I refuse to be silenced. I am a Child of the Living God. I belong to You. And I claim my place within Your Kingdom, under the shelter of Your wings, where the enemy has NO voice, NO access, NO power, and NO authority to torment me. If I’ve opened a door to the enemy through sin, I confess it now — and in the name of Jesus Christ, I revoke every demonic right, every lie, every foothold the enemy has tried to claim. That access is closed. That weapon is broken. That battle is Yours now, Lord — not mine. Father, I surrender everything to You.</p>

<p>Jesus, be my refuge. Be my strength. Be my rest. I don’t need to pretend to be strong anymore. I need to lean on You, lean into You, lean into my relationship with You. You said, “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” I’m coming now, with open hands and a tired heart. I fall into Your loving arms. I give You the weight of my worry, my finances, my delays, my disappointments, my unanswered prayers. I give You the ache of not having the things I think I need, the exhaustion of fighting alone, the tears I’m too proud to let anyone else see. You can have it all. Lord, I surrender all.</p>

<p>Surround me with Your presence. Put a hedge of protection around me — that no devil, no demon, no demonic force, no agent of darkness can penetrate. Where the enemy has monitored, disrupted, or blocked me, I ask You, King Jesus, to block them instead. Strike fear and trembling into every dark force that dares to come near me, or disrupt my life, or Your plans for my life. Render them silent, blind, mute, and powerless — not just today, but until the day You return in glory. Until then, strengthen my heart, my connection with You, my mission for You, my purpose for You, and my resolve as a Child of the Living God.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just relief, but rest. Not just survival, but strength. Not just calm, but courage. I desperately need a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that revives me in the wilderness, restores me in the valley, and raises me up like a warrior in Your name. I’m not done, Lord. I’m just tired. And I trust You to renew me. One breath at a time. One battle at a time. One victory at a time. Because I know who I am. I am Yours. And You are enough.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
