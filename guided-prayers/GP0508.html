<h2>A Prayer for Rejoicing in God’s Presence</h2>

<p>God, I rejoice in You — not just for what You’ve done, but because You are here. Right now. With me. I don’t have to earn it. I don’t have to beg for it. You’re not distant, distracted, or disengaged. You’re present. And that truth alone changes everything.</p>

<p>Your presence is not just a doctrine — it’s a delight. It’s peace when the world is spinning. It’s warmth when my heart feels cold. It’s strength when I feel weak. You are the God who draws near. Who walks with me, talks with me, listens to me, and loves me — even in the places where I’ve felt most unlovable.</p>

<p>I praise You, Lord, because Your presence is fullness of joy. I don’t need perfect circumstances to rejoice. I don’t need everything to make sense. I just need You, You are enough — and You’ve promised never to leave me or forsake me. That’s enough. That’s more than enough. I don’t rejoice because life is easy — I rejoice because You are with me in it.</p>

<p>Teach me to make space for Your presence, not just during church or quiet times, but in the ordinary, messy middle of my days. Let me feel You near when I’m doing dishes, driving, working, or resting. Let Your presence be my favorite place — the place I run to, the place I stay, the place I carry with me everywhere I go.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a passing spiritual experience, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where rejoicing becomes my rhythm, because I know that wherever I am, You are there with me. One where joy isn’t reserved for the mountaintop, but found even in the valley, because You’re walking beside me. Because Your presence is my joy.</p>

<p>Thank You for Your presence, God — for the gift of Emmanuel, God with us. I rejoice in You today, not because everything is perfect, but because You are.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
