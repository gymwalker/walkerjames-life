  <h3>ðŸŸ¦ Friday â€“ Intercession and Relationship</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>â–º Lord, thank You for the people You've placed in my life â€” friends, family, mentors, strangers â€” all of them part of my story.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me love well today. Not just with words, but with actions. Help me notice the needs of others and not just focus on myself.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me a soft heart toward those I find difficult. Let me see them the way You see them â€” broken, beloved, and worth redeeming.</li>
    <li>â–º Show me how to intercede with power and compassion. Let me carry others to You in prayer like the friends who lowered the paralyzed man through the roof.</li>
    <li>â–º I lift up my loved ones to You â€” their burdens, their dreams, their needs, their healing. Be near to them in ways I cannot be.</li>
    <li>â–º If thereâ€™s someone You want me to reach out to today, make it clear. I donâ€™t want to miss divine appointments disguised as interruptions.</li>
    <li>â–º Use my voice to encourage. Use my hands to serve. Use my presence to comfort. Let me be Your vessel of grace today.</li>
    <li>â–º Heal the broken relationships in my life â€” or at least heal the brokenness in me about them. Let me do my part, even if the other person wonâ€™t.</li>
    <li>â–º Show me the people who feel invisible. Help me speak life where others have spoken hurt. Help me offer hope where others have given up.</li>
    <li>â–º Give me discernment in every conversation. Not everything needs to be said. But when something needs to be spoken â€” help me say it with truth and love.</li>
    <li>â–º Let my prayers for others not just be wishful thinking â€” but powerful partnership with You. Help me believe that prayer actually changes things.</li>
    <li>â–º Strengthen my relationships. Protect them from pride, from comparison, from selfishness. Let love be the atmosphere and forgiveness the language.</li>
    <li>â–º Father, if someone is grieving today, comfort them. If someone is lost, find them. If someone is tired, carry them. Show me how to partner with You in all of it.</li>
    <li>â–º Thank You that relationship is at the core of who You are â€” Father, Son, Spirit â€” and You invite me into that same deep connection with You and others.</li>
    <li>â–º Help me be a peacemaker, not just a peacekeeper. Let my presence disarm tension, not add to it.</li>
    <li>â–º If Iâ€™ve been isolating, draw me back into community. Remind me that healing often comes through connection.</li>
    <li>â–º And when I pray for others, let it deepen my own faith â€” because Youâ€™re not just the God who hears, Youâ€™re the God who moves.</li>
