  <h3>🟧 Friday – Reflection and Intercession</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, thank You for walking with me through this week. Whether I’ve soared or stumbled, You’ve been faithful. I praise You for Your constant presence.</li>
    <li>► Lord, help me finish this week well — not coasting through the end, but living on pupose, and with purpose and integrity until the final moment.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve left any words unsaid or any love unshown to You, give me the courage to speak and act today. Don’t let me miss the chance to be Your hands and feet.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, teach me to live with eternity in mind. Every choice I make matters. Let my life store up treasure in Heaven — not just gather dust on earth.</li>
    <li>► Father, if I’ve been careless with my time or distracted by lesser things, help me realign my heart with Yours. Help me focus on what matters most to You.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that rest is holy. Show me how to enter into it without guilt, knowing it honors You and restores my soul.</li>
    <li>► Lord, if I’ve hurt anyone this week, bring it to my attention — and give me the humility and courage to make it right.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve carried a burden I wasn’t meant to bear, help me lay it at Your feet. You never asked me to carry the weight of the world — just to trust You, the One who holds it.</li>
    <li>► Father, I lift up the people I’ve encountered this week — friends, family, strangers, co-workers, even those who were difficult. Bless them. Work in their lives. Use our interactions for good. Open their eyes, heart, mind and soul to want what You want, a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate, relationship with You.</li>
    <li>► Lord, thank You for the open doors You’ve provided — and the closed ones too. I trust Your wisdom more than I trust my own wants, needs, passions, desires.</li>
    <li>► As I look back on this week, help me see where You were at work — even in the places I didn’t notice before.</li>
    <li>► Forgive me for the ways I’ve fallen short — in attitude, in word, in action, or in thought. Wash me clean and renew a right spirit within me.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with fresh joy. Joy that doesn’t depend on how things look. Joy that runs deeper than circumstances. Joy that comes from knowing You and Your truth.</li>
    <li>► Father, I give You the outcomes I’ve been worrying about. Whether things turned out how I wanted or not, I release them into Your hands — and I choose peace over anxiety.</li>
    <li>► Lord, teach me how to rest in Your sovereignty — not just with my words, but in my soul.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that it’s not about being productive — it’s about being present with You and letting You lead the way. Working with You not against You.</li>
    <li>► Help me let go of any regrets I’ve been holding onto. What’s done is done — and covered by Your grace. I choose to move forward with hope.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, thank You for being patient with me. For loving me when I fall short. For never walking away when I’m a mess. For being my safe place.</li>
    <li>► Strengthen my hope today — not a shallow optimism, but a deep trust that You are at work even when I don’t see it.</li>
    <li>► Lord, give me eyes to see this weekend as sacred time — not just time off, but time to reconnect with You, with loved ones, and with what matters most.</li>
    <li>► Keep me from the temptation to escape into distractions. Let my soul find its rest in You — not in scrolling, bingeing, or numbing. Help me make You and time with You a priority in my life.</li>
    <li>► Help me extend grace — to others, and to myself. If this week wasn’t perfect, it’s okay. I’m still Yours, still growing, still loved.</li>
    <li>► Teach me how to prepare my heart for worship — not just on Saturday or Sunday, but every day. Let praise become my default posture.</li>
    <li>► Let Your Spirit speak to me in the quiet. Even if it’s just one whisper — one word of truth — that word can change everything.</li>
    <li>► Thank You for being my provider, my peace, my protector, and my purpose. I’m not here by accident. I’m here on mission — with You, for You, and because of You.</li>
