  <h3>Friday...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, thank You for walking with me through this week. Whether I’ve soared or stumbled, You’ve been faithful. I praise You for Your constant presence.</li>
    <li>► Lord, help me finish this week well — not coasting through the end, but living with purpose and integrity until the final moment.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve left any words unsaid or any love unshown, give me the courage to speak and act today. Don’t let me miss the chance to be Your hands and feet.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, teach me to live with eternity in mind. Every choice I make matters. Let my life store up treasure in Heaven — not just gather dust on earth.</li>
    <li>► Father, if I’ve been careless with my time or distracted by lesser things, help me realign my heart with Yours. Help me focus on what matters most to You.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that rest is holy. Show me how to enter into it without guilt, knowing it honors You and restores my soul.</li>
    <li>► Lord, if I’ve hurt anyone this week, bring it to my attention — and give me the humility and courage to make it right.</li>
    <li>► If I’ve carried a burden I wasn’t meant to bear, help me lay it at Your feet. You never asked me to carry the weight of the world — just to trust the One who holds it.</li>
    <li>► Father, I lift up the people I’ve encountered this week — friends, family, strangers, even those who were difficult. Bless them. Work in their lives. Use our interactions for good.</li>
    <li>► Lord, thank You for the open doors You’ve provided — and the closed ones too. I trust Your wisdom more than I trust my own wants.</li>
    <li>► As I look back on this week, help me see where You were at work — even in the places I didn’t notice before.</li>
    <li>► Forgive me for the ways I’ve fallen short — in attitude, in word, in action, or in thought. Wash me clean and renew a right spirit within me.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with fresh joy. Joy that doesn’t depend on how things look. Joy that runs deeper than circumstances. Joy that comes from knowing You.</li>
    <li>► Father, I give You the outcomes I’ve been worrying about. Whether things turned out how I wanted or not, I release them to Your hands — and I choose peace over anxiety.</li>
    <li>► Lord, teach me how to rest in Your sovereignty — not just with my words, but in my soul.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that it’s not about being productive — it’s about being present with You and letting You lead the way.</li>
    <li>► Help me let go of any regrets I’ve been holding onto. What’s done is done — and covered by Your grace. I choose to move forward with hope.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, thank You for being patient with me. For loving me when I fall short. For never walking away when I’m a mess. For being my safe place.</li>
    <li>► Strengthen my hope today — not a shallow optimism, but a deep trust that You are at work even when I don’t see it.</li>
    <li>► Lord, give me eyes to see this weekend as sacred time — not just time off, but time to reconnect with You, with loved ones, and with what matters most.</li>
    <li>► Keep me from the temptation to escape into distractions. Let my soul find its rest in You — not in scrolling, bingeing, or numbing.</li>
    <li>► Help me extend grace — to others, and to myself. If this week wasn’t perfect, it’s okay. I’m still Yours, still growing, still loved.</li>
    <li>► Teach me how to prepare my heart for worship — not just on Sunday, but every day. Let praise become my default posture.</li>
    <li>► Lord, I praise You for who You are — not just what You’ve done. You are good, You are faithful, and You are worthy of my everything.</li>
    <li>► Let Your Spirit speak to me in the quiet. Even if it’s just one whisper — one word of truth — that word can change everything.</li>
    <li>► Thank You for being my provider, my peace, my protector, and my purpose. I’m not here by accident. I’m here on mission — with You, for You, and because of You.</li>
