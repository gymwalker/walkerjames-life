<h2>A Prayer for Protection Against the Enemy</h2>

<p>Father God, Most High — my Shield, my Refuge, my Fortress, and my Defender — I thank You that You are not only a Deliverer, but a Protector. You do not just set me free — You surround me with Your presence, and You guard what You’ve redeemed. So I come to You today, asking for supernatural protection from every tactic, scheme, ambush, and assignment of the enemy. Let no weapon formed against me prosper, and let every plan of the devil be exposed, dismantled, and destroyed — before it ever gets near.</p>

<p>I ask for divine protection over my mind — guard it from lies, fear, confusion, deception, distraction, temptation, and torment. Let the helmet of salvation stay firmly in place. Let Your Word anchor my thoughts and Your truth cast out every shadow. I declare that I have the mind of Christ, and no thought the enemy plants will take root or bear fruit.</p>

<p>I ask for divine protection over my heart — guard it from offense, bitterness, anger, lust, jealousy, and hopelessness. Let the breastplate of righteousness shield every part of me that feels vulnerable. Keep me soft, but guarded. Tender, but wise. Loving, but unshakable. Let my heart beat in rhythm with Yours — full of peace, purpose, power, and grace.</p>

<p>I ask for divine protection over my body — every cell, every system, every function. Protect me from sickness, disease, exhaustion, burnout, and anything the enemy would use to drain me or wear me down. Renew my strength daily. Let no unclean spirit touch what You’ve made holy, set apart for Your glory.</p>

<p>I ask for divine protection over my home, my family, my relationships, my work, my finances, my calling, and my future. Let the blood of Jesus mark every doorway. Let angels stand guard over every threshold. Let every dark force that attempts to enter be stopped by the absolute fear and terror of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the fire of Your presence. If any curse, hex, spell, attack, assignment, or demonic plan has been sent — I cancel it now, in the name of Jesus, and send it back to the pit from which it came.</p>

<p>Surround me with Your angels — warring, watching, ministering spirits sent to guard and protect what belongs to You. Let Your presence go before me, walk beside me, dwell within me, and cover me from behind. Let nothing touch me that doesn’t go through You first. And if You allow it, then use it for Your glory, because I know You waste nothing.</p>

<p>I want what You want — to walk in boldness, not fear; in peace, not panic; in truth, not torment. I want to live with a sincere passion and desire for a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — knowing that You are my covering, my strong tower, and my shield. You are my Protector, and because You are enough, I am not afraid.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ mighty and victorious name, Amen.</p>
