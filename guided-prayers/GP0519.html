<h2>A Prayer of Praise for God’s Mercy</h2>

<p>God, if not for Your mercy, I don’t know where I would be. You’ve seen the worst in me — and You didn’t turn away. You’ve witnessed every failure, every wrong choice, every moment I fell short — and instead of condemnation, You offered compassion. Instead of wrath, You gave mercy. I praise You, God, for Your mercy that is new every morning. For the way You hold back what I deserve, and pour out what I could never earn.</p>

<p>Your mercy doesn’t just rescue me once — it meets me again and again. It’s patient. It’s kind. It walks with me through every struggle and covers every scar. You know my heart, and You still choose me. You know my sin, and You still forgive me. You know my past, and yet You still call me forward. Your mercy rewrites my story. It restores my dignity. It lifts my face when shame tries to push it down.</p>

<p>I praise You for the cross — the ultimate act of mercy. I praise You for Jesus, who bore my punishment so I could be free. I praise You for the way Your mercy interrupts my spirals, softens my heart, and draws me back to You every time I wander. You’re not keeping score — You’re holding out Your hand. And even when I fall, You’re still here, whispering, “Come home.”</p>

<p>God, teach me to live like someone covered in mercy. Help me to see others the way You see me — not with judgment, but with compassion. Let Your mercy shape my words, my reactions, and my relationships. Help me to praise You, not just when I feel clean and strong, but especially when I feel unworthy — because that’s where Your mercy shines brightest.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just behavior change, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that is rooted in mercy, built on grace, and anchored in Your love and Your truth. One that continually brings me back to Your heart — humbled, forgiven, and loved.</p>

<p>Thank You, Father, for being the God of mercy. Not just once. Not just sometimes. But always.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
