<h2>A Prayer for When You Don’t Know What You Need</h2>

<p>Father, I don’t even know what to ask for right now. I just know something’s off. Something’s missing. Something in me feels unsettled, restless, or stuck — and I can’t put it into words. I don’t know what to pray. I don’t know what I’m supposed to want, or change, or do. I just know I need You. And maybe that’s the only thing I need to know right now. I need You!</p>

<p>I’m tired of trying to fix things I don’t understand. Tired of chasing solutions I can’t find. Tired of feeling like I have to have it all figured out before I come to You. I lay all of that down now. I lay down the need to know. I lay down the need to understand. I lay down the need to control. I lay down the pressure to be strong, wise, or “put together.” You’re not asking for that. You’re asking for me — just as I am.</p>

<p>So here I am. Confused, uncertain, a little frustrated… but open. I give You access to every corner of my heart, every corner of my being, every corner of my soul — even the parts I can’t describe. You already know what’s going on inside me. You already know what I need most. So I ask You, God: speak to what I don’t see. Heal what I don’t understand. Provide what I don’t know to ask for. Lead me when I don’t know the way. You are my Shepherd, even when I don’t know where we’re going.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, intercede for me. Pray through me. Guide me into truth even when I can’t articulate the question. Let Your presence be greater than my confusion. Give me peace that makes no sense — peace that isn’t based on understanding, but on Your faithfulness. And when clarity comes, let it come with confidence in You, not in myself.</p>

<p>I want what You want… even when I don’t know what that is. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — the kind that trusts without answers, listens without clarity, and obeys without a detailed plan or map. Teach me to rest in the mystery of You and Your love. Teach me to trust the God who sees the whole picture… even when I’m staring at a single frame. And I don't know what I need. But, I do know, I love You, and for now, that is enough.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
