<h2>A Prayer for Someone Grieving</h2>

<p>Father, I lift up someone I love who is grieving. You see the emptiness in their heart. You know the depth of their sorrow. You understand the pain of loss more than anyone — because You’ve felt it. You know what it’s like to weep. You know what it’s like to be crushed by sorrow. And You know exactly how to walk with them through this valley.</p>

<p>I ask You to be near — closer than breath. Wrap them in Your peace, even when everything around them feels shattered. Let them feel Your presence when the house is quiet and the tears won’t stop. Be with them in the memories, in the flashbacks, in the moments when it suddenly hits all over again. Speak gently into their heartbreak, and let them know that they don’t have to grieve alone.</p>

<p>Father, guard them from lies — the lie that they should be “over it” by now, the lie that joy will never return, the lie that You’re far away. Silence the voices that rush them through healing. Grief isn’t a straight line, and You’re not in a hurry. Let them grieve fully, honestly, and at their own pace — while still anchored in You and Your hope. Let them cry. Let them question. Let them remember. And let them heal, in Your timing and Your way.</p>

<p>Use this pain, Lord — not to punish, but to plant something deep. Something eternal. A tenderness for others. A compassion that reflects Your heart. A depth that only sorrow can carve out. Let this loss become holy ground — not because it doesn’t hurt, but because You meet them in it. You’re the God who bottles tears. Who restores broken things. Who brings beauty from ashes. Do that for them, Lord. Bring beauty here — somehow, some way.</p>

<p>And Father, when the time is right, gently remind them — if the one they’ve lost knew You, then this goodbye is not forever. This pain is real, but it’s not eternal. Plant within them the hope that this isn’t the end of the story — it’s just a new chapter. Let that hope take root, not to dismiss the grief, but to anchor it in eternity. Show them that love doesn’t die — it lives on in You. That every memory, every moment, every act of love is a treasure stored in heaven, waiting to be fully redeemed in Your presence.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just comfort, but transformation. A stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — for me and my friend, born even in the midst of grief. Remind them that this isn’t the end of the story. That You are still good. That hope still lives. And that the one they lost is never forgotten — not by them, and never by You.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
