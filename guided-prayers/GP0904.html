<h2>A Prayer for Breaking Demonic Strongholds</h2>

<p>Father God, I come before You in the name of Jesus — not with fear, not with doubt, but with faith in Your unmatched power. You are the chain-breaker. The stronghold-shatterer. The deliverer of the captives. I acknowledge that some of what I’ve been facing isn’t just emotional, mental, or circumstantial — it’s spiritual. There are strongholds that have tried to take root in my mind, my heart, my body, my bloodline, and my habits… but today, in Your power, I say no more.</p>

<p>By the blood of Jesus and the authority I have as Your child, I come out of agreement with every lie I’ve believed. Every foothold I’ve given. Every sin I’ve tolerated. Every door I’ve left cracked open. Every generational curse passed down. Every trauma left untreated. Every addiction left hidden. I renounce them all. I refuse to carry what Jesus already died to destroy.</p>

<p>I break the stronghold of fear.  
I break the stronghold of shame.  
I break the stronghold of rejection.  
I break the stronghold of lust.  
I break the stronghold of pride.  
I break the stronghold of addiction.  
I break the stronghold of comparison, control, bitterness, anxiety, and self-hate.</p>

<p>I don’t break these in my own strength, Lord — I break them in the power of the name above every name: Jesus Christ. I declare that these strongholds have no legal right to remain. Let every chain snap. Let every wall fall. Let every demonic foothold be shattered by the Word of truth and the fire of Your Spirit. What once enslaved me will now be under my feet.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, fill every place that has been emptied. Every dark room — fill it with light. Every lie — replace it with God's truth. Every root — pull it up and plant something new. I ask for complete restoration, complete transformation, not just release. Teach me how to walk in freedom daily, how to guard what’s been cleansed, and how to build a new stronghold — one that belongs to You and You alone.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just deliverance, but transformation. Not just a temporary breakthrough, but a permanent change. I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one that no demon, no memory, no addiction, and no lie can ever come between.</p>

<p>In the mighty name of Jesus — the One who died, rose, reigns, and lives inside me — I declare it done. I am free. I am clean. I am Yours. Because You are always enough.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
