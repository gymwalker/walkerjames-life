  <h3>⬛ Sunday – Victory and Renewal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, thank You for this new day — a day to worship, a day to pause, a day to be filled again.</li>
    <li>► I dedicate this day to You. Let it be set apart — not just because it’s Sunday, but because I want to honor You with it.</li>
    <li>► Quiet the noise in my heart. Remove distractions. I don’t want to rush into Your presence — I want to come with reverence, awe, and expectancy.</li>
    <li>► Prepare my heart to meet with You today — whether at church, at home, or anywhere I lift my voice in worship. Don’t let it be routine. Let it be real.</li>
    <li>► Let every word I sing today be more than lyrics. Let every note be a declaration of who You are and how much I love You.</li>
    <li>► If I hear a message today, let it not just be information. Let it be transformation. Speak through it directly to my heart.</li>
    <li>► Help me show up fully — body, soul, mind, and spirit — ready to hear from You, ready to respond, ready to be changed.</li>
    <li>► Lord, forgive me for any pride, bitterness, or unforgiveness I’ve carried into this day. I lay it at Your feet right now.</li>
    <li>► Search my heart, O God. Show me anything I need to make right. Cleanse me. Renew me. Restore me.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, thank You for being my Sabbath. You are my rest. My refuge. My renewal. In You, I find everything I need.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with gratitude today. Let thanksgiving be the posture of my heart. Let me remember how faithful You’ve been.</li>
    <li>► Let today be a divine reset — a spiritual recalibration. Anchor my week in Your presence, in Your truth, and in Your love.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that church is not just a building — I am the Church. I carry Your Spirit. Help me reflect You wherever I go.</li>
    <li>► Help me set aside my agenda and make space for whatever divine interruptions You want to bring my way today.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with Your joy — not the shallow kind that depends on circumstances, but the deep, unshakable joy of knowing You.</li>
    <li>► Let my time with You today overflow into my week — shaping my thoughts, guiding my choices, and filling me with Your Spirit.</li>
    <li>► If I feel distant from You, draw me close. If I’ve grown numb, wake me up. If I’ve been distracted, help me focus on You again.</li>
    <li>► Let this Sunday not just end the week but begin a new one — one that’s rooted in worship, grounded in truth, and led by You.</li>
    <li>► Help me walk in humility today — to listen, to serve, to encourage, to love — not for attention, but for Your glory.</li>
    <li>► Give me eyes to see the lonely, the hurting, the overlooked. Let me be a vessel of Your compassion today.</li>
    <li>► If there are people I need to reconnect with or forgive, give me the courage and grace to take the first step.</li>
    <li>► I choose to rejoice in this day. This is the day that You have made. I will be glad in it. I will honor You with it — because You are worthy.</li>
    <li>► I receive Your rest today — not just physical rest, but soul rest. Let my spirit breathe deeply in Your presence.</li>
    <li>► Thank You, Father, for loving me as I am. I come into Your presence today not with perfection, but with hunger — to know You more.</li>
    <li>► Yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory — not just forever, but right here, right now, in my life today.</li>
  </ul>
