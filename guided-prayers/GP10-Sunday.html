  <h3>⬛ 🌅 Sunday – Rising in Worship and Renewal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>► Father, thank You for this new day — a day to worship, a day to pause, a day to be filled again.</li>
    <li>► I dedicate this day to You. Let it be set apart — not just because it’s Sunday, but because I want to honor You with it.</li>
    <li>► ⭐ Before the distractions of the day creep in, fix my eyes on You. Let this day begin with stillness, worship, and awe.</li>
    <li>► Quiet the noise in my heart. Remove distractions. I don’t want to rush into Your presence — I want to come with reverence, with awe, with expectancy.</li>
    <li>► Prepare my heart to meet with You today — whether at church, at home, or anywhere I lift my voice in worship. Don’t let it be routine. Let it be real.</li>
    <li>► Help me show up fully — body, soul, mind, and spirit — ready to hear from You, ready to respond, ready to be changed.</li>
    <li>► Let every word I sing today be more than lyrics. Let every note be a declaration of who You are and how much I love You.</li>
    <li>► ⭐ Whether I hear it from a pulpit, read it in silence, or sing it in worship — let Your Word pierce my heart, transform my mind, and lead my steps.</li>
    <li>► If I hear a message today, let it not just be information. Let it be transformation. Speak through it directly to my heart.</li>
    <li>► Remind me that church is not just a building — I am the Church. I carry Your Spirit. Help me reflect You wherever I go.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with gratitude today. Let thanksgiving be the posture of my heart. Let me remember how faithful You’ve been.</li>
    <li>► If I feel distant from You, draw me close. If I’ve grown numb, wake me up. If I’ve been distracted, help me focus on You again.</li>
    <li>► Lord, forgive me for any pride, bitterness, or unforgiveness I’ve carried into this day. I lay it at Your feet right now.</li>
    <li>► Search my heart, O God. Show me anything I need to make right. Cleanse me. Renew me. Restore me.</li>
    <li>► Help me walk in humility today — to listen, to serve, to encourage, to love — not for attention, but for Your glory.</li>
    <li>► Give me eyes to see the lonely, the hurting, the overlooked. Let me be a vessel of Your compassion today.</li>
    <li>► ⭐ Don’t let this moment of worship fade with the afternoon sun. Let today’s encounter shape the way I live all week long.</li>
    <li>► Let today be a reset — a spiritual recalibration. Anchor my week in Your presence, in Your truth, and in Your love.</li>
    <li>► Fill me with Your joy — not the shallow kind that depends on circumstances, but the deep, unshakable joy of knowing You.</li>
    <li>► Father, I receive Your rest today. Not just physical rest, but soul rest — the kind only You can give.</li>
    <li>► If there are people I need to reconnect with or forgive, give me the courage and grace to take the first step.</li>
    <li>► Help me set aside my agenda and make space for whatever divine interruptions You want to bring my way today.</li>
    <li>► Jesus, thank You for being my Sabbath. You are my rest. My refuge. My renewal. In You, I find everything I need.</li>
    <li>► ⭐ If I’ve been defined by failure, busyness, or comparison — remind me again: I am Yours. Loved. Redeemed. Chosen. Called.</li>
    <li>► Let my time with You today overflow into my week — shaping my thoughts, guiding my choices, and filling me with Your Spirit.</li>
    <li>► Let this Sunday not just end the week but begin a new one — one that’s rooted in worship, grounded in truth, and led by You.</li>
    <li>► Thank You, Father, for loving me as I am. I come into Your presence today not with perfection, but with hunger — to know You more.</li>
    <li>► This is the day that You have made. I will rejoice. I will be glad in it. I will honor You with it — because You are worthy.</li>
