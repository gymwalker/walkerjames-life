<h2>A Prayer for My Husband</h2>

<p>Father, thank You for the gift of my husband. Thank You for his life, his heart, his strengths, and even his struggles. You know him completely — his hopes, his fears, his dreams, his burdens. You see what he carries that he doesn’t talk about. You know where he feels inadequate, where he feels unseen, and where he quietly aches for something more. And You love him in and through all of it.</p>

<p>God, I lift him up to You. Cover him with Your presence. Remind him that he is not alone — that You are for him, with him, and within him. Strengthen him in the areas where he feels weak. Speak truth into the lies he’s believed. Surround him with people who will challenge him, encourage him, and point him back to You again and again, people that will speak truth into his life.</p>

<p>Help me to love him well — not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard. Help me to give him grace, to forgive quickly, and to always encourage him to fall more in love with You. Teach me to speak with grace, to listen with compassion, and to support him with prayer even when I don’t fully understand what he’s facing. Show me how to be his partner, his greatest support, his friend, and his encourager, his lover, his passionate wife. Give me wisdom to know when to step in, and humility to know when to step back and trust You to work.</p>

<p>Lead him, Lord. Lead him in his calling, in his leadership, in his identity as Your son. Equip him for every good work. Guard his mind, guard his heart, and guard our marriage. Let him feel Your strength when he’s tired, Your peace when he’s anxious, and Your delight when he forgets his worth. Help him to feel and know my support, my love, my desire, and my passion for him. And help us to always bring You into the center of our relationship and to enjoy You together as You created us to do. Give us not only unity with each other, but unity with You, our Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And Father, help me to guard my heart and mind, so that nothing in me becomes a foothold for the enemy in our marriage. Keep me from gossip, resentment, comparison, flirtation, emotional disconnect, or anything else that would draw my affection or attention away from my husband or from You. Help me to stay pure in thought, word, and action — not just for the sake of avoiding sin, but because I value our relationship and want to protect the sacred trust between us. Let my eyes, my body, my heart, and my desires be fully his — and fully surrendered to You. If anything has started to take root that doesn’t belong, bring it into the light and remove it. I want to love him with a clear conscience, a clean heart, and unwavering loyalty, so that our love grows stronger, not weaker, with time.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just for his success or stability, but for something far greater — a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. I want his heart to beat in rhythm with Yours. I want him to know the joy of walking closely with You, hearing Your voice, and living out his purpose. Bring the right people, the right words, the right teachings, the right moments to help shape him into the man You’ve created him to be. And as You lead him, help me follow You too, faithfully, prayerfully, and joyfully — walking beside him with respect, appreciation, love and trust.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
