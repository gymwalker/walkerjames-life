<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Unworthy to Begin Again</h2>

<p>Father, I want to begin again… but deep down, I’m not sure I deserve to. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve let You down. I’ve let others down. And I’ve let myself believe that maybe I’ve disqualified myself from another chance. I know what I’ve done. I know where I’ve failed. And it’s hard to imagine You still wanting me after all that.</p>

<p>I’ve listened to the voice that says I’m too far gone. That I’ve blown it too many times. That I'm no longer trust-worthy. That I should sit on the sidelines, stay silent, shrink back. That voice sounds convincing… but it’s not Yours. Your voice says, “Come home.” Your voice says, “It is finished.” Your voice says, “I still choose you.” Your voice says, "I love you!" And I want to believe it — even if it’s hard right now.</p>

<p>So I come to You, not because I feel worthy, but because I know You are good. I come not with confidence in myself, but with hope in Your mercy and Your grace. You’re not asking me to earn my way back — You’re just asking me to come. To trust. To receive. To believe that grace really is greater than my guilt. I lay all of my sins, all of my failures, all of my past at Your feet and ask you to fogive me. And I thank you for forgiving me. I know some of these things may still have consequences to them, but at last, I am free of them and forgiven by You.</p>

<p>Jesus, thank You for what You did on the cross. Thank You that my worth isn’t measured by my past, but by Your blood. Thank You that You’ve never been ashamed of me. Thank You that You still want a relationship with me — not a shallow one, but a deep, honest, transforming one. I lay my shame down at Your feet. I lay the lie that says “I’m not enough” at the foot of the cross. And I choose to receive what You already paid for — forgiveness, freedom, healing, and a new beginning.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a second chance, but a redeemed heart. A restored identity. A stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. One that isn’t based on performance, but on grace. One that’s real — even if it starts from brokenness. Thank You for seeing me, loving me, calling me… still. I’m Yours. I’m home.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
