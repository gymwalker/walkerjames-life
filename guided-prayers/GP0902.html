<h2>A Prayer to Resist the Devil and Make Him Flee</h2>

<p>Father God, in the name of Jesus Christ — I submit to You right now. I resist the devil. I resist every tactic, every lie, every temptation, and every accusation he’s sending my way. I will not bow. I will not give in. I will not belive his lies. I belong to You, I am a Child of the Living God — and no power of hell has any right to speak to me, my thoughts, my heart, my soul. I am ALL Yours.</p>

<p>Satan, is a liar, defeated, disarmed. He was crushed by the Cross of Jesus Christ and His resurrection. The cross broke his back. The blood stripped his authority. And the name of Jesus has crushed his head beneath the heel of Jesus Christ. Just like you spoke about in the Garden of Eden. He has no place here. No authority here. No voice here. By the power and authority I have in Jesus Christ and as a Child of the Living God, I all devils, demons, and demonic forces, including satan, to flee from my life, my mind, my family, my emotions, my body, my finances, and my future — I declare this in the most Holy Name of Jesus.</p>

<p>I resist and renounce the spirit of fear. I resist and renounce the spirit of confusion. I resist and renounce the spirit of division. I resist and renounce the spirit of heaviness. I resist and renounce temptation, manipulation, intimidation, and condemnation. I will not negotiate with darkness — I will expose it, rebuke it, and declare the truth over it: I am a child of the living God, filled with the Spirit of God, and covered by the blood of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, flood every part of me that the enemy has tried to occupy. Take back Your territory, my life. Cleanse every shadow. Fill every crack. Where the devil tried to speak, let Your voice thunder louder. Where the enemy tried to discourage, let Your promises rise. Where lies were planted, let Your truth uproot and replace them. Let Your presence be so strong in me that darkness can’t breathe near me.</p>

<p>I declare that I am not powerless. I am not passive. I am not prey. I am armed. I am awake. I am aligned with the King of Kings. And I fight from victory — not for it. The enemy flees not because of who I am, but because of who stands with me. His name is Jesus. His blood speaks louder than my shame. His Word is my weapon. And His Spirit is my strength.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a life of spiritual alertness, power, authority, and intimacy with You. I want a heart that discerns the enemy's schemes before they take root. I want a spirit that resists without delay and stands firm in You without fear. Let me live like someone who knows You’re greater — because You are. I want You Father, I want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You, no matter what that takes.</p>

<p>Today, I resist. Today, I stand. Today, I walk in freedom — not by my might, not by my power, but by Your might, Your power and Your Spirit.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>
