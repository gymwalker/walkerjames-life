<h2>A Prayer to Put On the Armor of God</h2>

<p>Father God, in the mighty name of Jesus, I stand before You today as a soldier in Your Kingdom — not in my own strength, but in the strength of the Lord and in the power of Your might. I refuse to go into this day spiritually exposed or casually dressed. I put on the full armor of God — every piece, every purpose, every promise, adding some additional weapons you've given us to compliment to the ones Paul speaks about directly in Ephesians 6 — because I know the enemy does not take days off, so, neither can I.</p>

<p>I fasten the belt of truth around my waist — Your truth, not the world’s. Let it hold everything else in place. Remind me of who You are, what You’ve said, and what never changes, no matter what lies I hear today.</p>

<p>I put on the breastplate of righteousness — not my own, but the righteousness of Christ. Let it guard my heart from guilt, shame, and condemnation. I belong to You, and my heart beats for Your glory alone.</p>

<p>On my feet I strap the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. Let me walk boldly, speak wisely, and move quickly when You call me. Make me a peacemaker in a world at war — but never a peacekeeper when truth is on the line. Let me carry the good news into every room I enter today.</p>

<p>I raise the shield of faith — not a flimsy hope, but a solid, battle-worn shield soaked in Your promises. Quench every flaming arrow of doubt, fear, lust, pride, distraction, and despair. I declare that no weapon formed against me shall prosper.</p>

<p>I put on the helmet of salvation — guard my mind from toxic thoughts, spiritual confusion, and identity theft. Remind me that I am saved, sealed, secured, and sanctified — not because of what I’ve done, but because of what Jesus did.</p>

<p>And I grip tightly the sword of the Spirit — Your living, breathing Word. Let it cut through lies. Let it dismantle strongholds. Let it declare truth, rebuke darkness, and bring freedom where there’s bondage. Teach me how to wield it with precision and power, not just read it — but speak it, believe it, live it.</p>

<p>And Father, I don’t just stop at the armor. I pick up the weapons You gave beyond it — prayer, praise and worship of You, and the blood of Jesus. Let my prayers shake hell and tear down strongholds. Let my worship blind and mute the enemy so that thier lies are of no effect. Let the blood of Jesus cover me completely — my past, my present, my mind, my household, and my future.</p>

<p>Today, I stand fully clothed in You, fully covered by You, and fully committed to You. I am a warrior of the Most High God. I will not back down. I will not bow to fear. I will not retreat. I am armed. I am ready. I am Yours. Because, YOU are enough.</p>

<p>I want what You want — complete victory, total freedom, and a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. March me forward in that truth today, King Jesus. And when I stand, let me stand firm with You, in Your power, in Your strengh.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.</p>
