<h2>A Prayer for My Country</h2>

<p>Father, I lift up my country to You. You see its condition more clearly than I ever could — the division, the deception, the brokenness, the corruption, the confusion. But You also see its potential, its people, its calling, and its need for You. I know this nation is not beyond Your reach, not beyond redemption, and not too far gone for revival. So I come to You now, not with fear, but with faith.</p>

<p>Lord Jesus, bind every devil, demon, and demonic force at work in this land. Bind every spirit of division, pride, violence, deception, racism, rebellion, corruption, idolatry, and hatred. Silence the voices that twist truth. Paralyze the strategies of the enemy with the terror of Your holy name. And even if darkness has been invited in — by leaders, laws, culture, or compromise — override it by Your power. Place a hedge of protection around this country, from its smallest towns to its highest offices. Let no agenda, no lie, no scheme succeed against Your will.</p>

<p>Father God, Lord Jesus, precious Holy Spirit — pour out Your Spirit on this land. Convict hearts where there is sin. Wake up those who have grown numb. Bring repentance where there has been arrogance, and healing where there has been deep wounding. Raise up leaders who are righteous, just, humble, and courageous — who seek Your face more than they seek approval. Expose what is hidden, the lies they've been telling, and bring Your truth to bear. Break what is unholy. Restore what has been lost. And birth something new and holy that reflects Your Kingdom more than our own comfort.</p>

<p>Make this nation an instrument of Your peace. Where there is injustice, let us sow righteousness. Where there is anger, let us sow grace. Where there is brokenness, let us sow healing. Where there is fear, let us sow faith. Where there is darkness, let us shine with Your light, and Your love. Let us be a people marked not by nationalism, but by the name of Jesus Christ — people who are known for loving truth, walking in humility, and living with bold conviction and compassion. Help this Country to desire to be more like Jesus, loving, caring, kind!</p>

<p>And Father, start with me. Let me not just pray for change — let me live it. Let me be a carrier of Your peace, Your truth, and Your courage in my conversations, my choices, and my citizenship. Help me stand for what’s right without losing love, and speak with truth without losing grace. Show me where to serve, where to give, where to vote, where to speak — and where to be still and pray.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just a successful or safe country, but a transformed one. A country where hearts beat for You. Where laws align with truth. Where revival touches every corner, and where people hunger for a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You. Do what only You can do. Let this land turn back to You — not by might, not by politics, but by Your Spirit.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
