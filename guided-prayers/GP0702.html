<h2>A Prayer of Repentance and Surrender</h2>

<p>Father, I’m done pretending. I’m done making excuses, pointing fingers, or trying to justify what I know is wrong. I’ve sinned — against You, against others, and even against myself. And I’m not here to sugarcoat it. I’m here to lay it down. To call it what it is. To stop carrying what I was never meant to hold. I confess it all to You — not because You don’t already know, but because I don’t want to hide anymore. I understand how offensive sin is to You, if I'm being honest, its offensive to me as well. The problem with it is that it has this ellusive lure of pleasure to it that never satisfies. And I'm sorry, truly sorry for getting sucked into mine.</p>

<p>Forgive me, Lord. Wash me clean. Take every broken piece, every selfish motive, every proud thought, every secret shame — and cover it in the blood of Jesus. I don’t want to just say I’m sorry… I want to turn. I want to change. I want to walk in a different direction, led by Your Spirit, not by my flesh. I’ve tried doing life my own way, and it never leads to freedom. It only leaves me empty.</p>

<p>So today, I surrender. I give You my heart, my habits, my wounds, my will, my desires, and my future. I surrender my need to control, my fear of the unknown, and my obsession with what others think. I release the idols I’ve clung to — comfort, approval, security, success — and I choose You instead. Not just as my Savior, but as my Lord. My King. My everything.</p>

<p>Change me from the inside out. Teach me how to walk in obedience, not obligation. Teach me how to say “yes” even when it’s hard. Teach me how to love what You love and hate what You hate — starting with the sin that’s poisoned my own heart. Make me holy, not just polished. Make me faithful, not just busy. Make me more like Jesus, more loving, more caring, more kind.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just forgiveness, but transformation. Not just mercy, but maturity. I truly want a stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — one where nothing is off-limits, and nothing is held back. You can have it all, I give You all of me. I trust You. I surrender. I'm Yours.</p>

<p>And Father, I know I can’t do this alone. I need You — and I need the right people, the right voices, the right tools. Lead me to a church that teaches Your Word with truth and grace. Surround me with godly friends who challenge me, encourage me, and call me higher. Help me replace the voices that tear me down with ones that speak life. Show me what to delete from my life, and what to install — literally. Give me apps, books, sermons, podcasts, music — anything that will strengthen my faith and help me grow. I want to invest in this relationship with You like it matters… because it does.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
