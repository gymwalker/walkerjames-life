<h2>A Prayer for a Broken Friendship</h2>

<p>Father, You know the ache in my heart over the loss of this friendship. You saw how close we once were — how much laughter, trust, loyalty, and life we shared. And You’ve seen what’s happened since. The hurt. The silence. The misunderstanding. The betrayal. The distance. Maybe I said something I shouldn’t have. Maybe they did. Maybe we both failed each other in different ways. But whatever broke between us, You saw it all. And You care about it deeply.</p>

<p>I bring this broken friendship to You. Not to vent. Not to blame. But to lay it down. Because I don’t want bitterness to build. I don’t want walls to harden. I don’t want to carry anger or regret or pride that keeps me from healing — or from hearing You. So I surrender the pain, the questions, the confusion, and the longing for closure. I trust You to deal with their heart, and I invite You to keep working in mine.</p>

<p>If there’s something I need to own, show me. If I need to apologize, soften my heart. If I need to forgive, help me do it for real — not just with words, but with freedom. If it’s time to reach out, give me courage. And if it’s time to let go, give me peace. I’m not asking for perfection — I’m asking for Your presence in the middle of this mess. Because I know You restore what we can't. You redeem what we thought was lost. This is the perfect job for You.</p>

<p>Lord, I pray for them too. Bless them. Heal them. Speak to them. If they’re hurting from this like I am, meet them in that pain. Surround them with people who love well and speak truth. And if this friendship has run its course, I still ask that You would protect them, provide for them, and draw them closer to You in every way.</p>

<p>I want what You want… not just repaired feelings, but hearts that are made whole. A stronger, closer, deeper, more loving, more personal, more passionate, more intimate relationship with You — for both of us. Whether You bring us back together or allow us to continue to grow apart, let it be for Your glory. And don’t let this break turn us bitter — let it make each of us better, more compassionate, and more surrendered to You. And more like Your Son Jesus, loving, caring, and kind.</p>

<p><em>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</em></p>
