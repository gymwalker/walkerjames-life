<p>Dear Friend,</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing your heart with God through your letter. We’ve received it and it’s currently under review by our team. If you requested a response, someone will prayerfully reply soon.</p>

<p>Your letter is personal and sacred—it’s between you and God. But please know, you are not alone. Others may visit your letter, lift it up in prayer, or quietly respond with a reaction. We don’t send updates about that, but you can revisit your letter anytime here:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://walkerjames.life/my-ltg?LetterID=XXXX">View My Letter to God</a></strong></p>

<p>And if you feel led, we invite you to read the letters of others on the <a href="https://walkerjames.life/ltg-wall">Letters to God Wall</a>. You’ll find stories of heartbreak, hope, longing, and faith—just like yours. As you read, consider lifting them up in prayer too. We’re all walking this journey together.</p>

<p>With love and gratitude,  
<br>— Walker James & The Letters to God Team</p>
